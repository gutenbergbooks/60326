<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>THE PLACE</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grey twilight gives to the long, pale stretches of
sand the sense of something strangely unreal. As far
as the eye can reach, it curves out into the mist, the last
vanishing garments, as it were, of some fleeing ghost. The
sea comes, smoothly, quite silently, over the breast of it;
there is a trembling whisper as it catches the highest stretch
of sand and drags it for a moment down the slope, then, with
a little sigh, creeps back again a defeated lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sky is grey, with an orange light hovering on its outer
edges, the last signal of the setting sun. A very faint mist
is creeping gradually over the sea, so faint that the silver
circle of the rising moon shines quite clearly through the
shadows; but it changes the pale yellow of the ghostly sand
into a dark grey land without form and void, seeming for a
moment to be one with sea and sky, and then rising again,
out of obscurity, into definite substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is silence here in the creek, save for the rustling
and whisper of the sea, but round the bend of the rocks the
noises of the town come full upon the ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town is built up from the sand on the side of the hill,
and rises, tier upon tier, until it finds its pinnacle in the
church tower and the roofs of the “Man at Arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in the dusk, the lights shine, row upon row, out
over the sand. From the market comes the sound of a fair—harsh,
discordant tunes softened by the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church clock strikes eight, and a bell rings stridently
somewhere in the depths of the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a distant rumble, a roar, a flash of light, and a
train glides into the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the sea pays no heed, and, round the bend of the
creek, the sand gleams white beneath the moon, and the mist
rises from the heart of the waves.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch02'>CHAPTER II</h1>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>IN WHICH OUR HERO AND THE PLACE MEET ONCE AGAIN</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maradicks had reserved four seats by the 10.45,
and so really there was no reason for arriving at Paddington
a few minutes after ten. But, as it happened, it
was quite fortunate, because there were so many people
travelling that the porters seemed to have little scruple as
to whether you’d reserved something or not, and just went
about pulling pink labels off and sticking pink labels on in
a way that was really grossly immoral. But Mrs. Maradick,
having discovered that her own pink ticket was all right—“James
Maradick, Esq.: Four seats by the 10.45. Travelling
to Treliss”—could afford to be complacent about other
people, and even a little triumphant over the quite amusing
misfortunes of a party of six who seemed to have no
chance whatever of securing a seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick always shut her mouth very tight indeed
when going off for a holiday. She entered the station
with the air of one who had a very sharp battle to fight
and wasn’t going to be beaten under any circumstances.
She selected a porter with the confidence of a very old
general who could tell a man at a glance, and she marshalled
him up and down the platform with a completeness and a
magnificent strategy that left him at last breathless and
confused, with scarcely energy enough to show indignation
at the threepence with which she rewarded his services.
But to-day things were finished sooner than usual, and by
half-past ten, with a quarter of an hour to spare, she was
able to pay attention to her friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite a number of them had come to see her off—Mrs.
Martin Fraser, Louie Denis, Mrs. Mackintosh, Maggie
Crowder, and those silly girls, the Dorringtons; and actually
Tom Craddock—very short, very fat, very breathless—a
little bit of a bounder, perhaps, but a man who served her
husband with a quite pathetic devotion. Yes, of course,
<span class='it'>he’d</span> come to say good-bye to James, so he didn’t count in
quite the same way, but still it was nice of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! the papers! James, I <span class='it'>must</span> have papers! Oh!
thank you, Mr. Craddock. What? Oh, I think, perhaps,
the <span class='it'>Lady’s Pictorial</span> and the <span class='it'>Queen</span>—and oh! if you wouldn’t
mind, the <span class='it'>Daily Mail</span> and the <span class='it'>Mirror</span>, and—oh! James has
the <span class='it'>Mail</span>, so perhaps the <span class='it'>Express</span> would be better—and yes,
just something for the girls—what do you say, Annie dear?
The <span class='it'>Girl’s Realm</span>? Yes, please, the <span class='it'>Girl’s Realm</span>, Mr. Craddock,
and the <span class='it'>Girl’s Own Paper</span> for Isabel. Rather a lot,
isn’t it, Louie, but it’s <span class='it'>such</span> a long journey—hours and hours—and
the girls get so restless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies gathered in a little phalanx round the carriage
window. They always felt this departure of Emmy Maradick’s;
every year it was the same. Epsom wasn’t a bit the
same place whilst she was away, and they really couldn’t
see why she should go away at all. Epsom was at its very
nicest in August, and that was the month of the year when
she could be most useful. Everyone gave their tennis-parties
then; and there were those charming little summer dances,
and there was no garden in Epsom like the Maradicks’!
Besides, they liked her for herself. Things always seemed
to go so well when she was there, she had such a—what was
the word?—a French phrase—<span class='it'>savoire-vivre</span> or <span class='it'>savoir-faire</span>—yes,
it really was a pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall miss you, dear.” This from Mrs. Mackintosh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s sweet of you, Katie darling. And I shall miss
all of you, ever so much. And a hotel’s never the same thing,
is it? And the garden’s just beginning to look lovely.
You’ll go in, once or twice, won’t you, Louie, and see that
things are all right? Of course they ought to be; but you
never can tell, with quite a new gardener, too. I think he’s
steady enough—at least, he had excellent testimonials, and
James heard from Mr. Templeton, where he was before,
you know, that he was quite a reliable man; but you know
what it is when one’s away, how everything seems to go——Oh!
no, it’s all right, Mr. Craddock, I don’t think it’s going
just yet. Sit down, Annie dear, and don’t lean against the
door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies then passed before the door, one after another,
delivered their little messages, and lined up on the other side.
Thus Mrs. Mackintosh—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear, I <span class='it'>do</span> hope you have the rippingest time. I’m
sure you deserve it after that old bazaar—all the worry——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Martin Fraser—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind, a postcard, dear—when you get there—just a line.
We shall all so want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Louie Denis—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darling, don’t forget the sketch you promised. I shall
have a frame all ready—waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Maggie Crowder—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it will be fine, dear—such a nuisance if it’s wet;
and then there’s our tennis dance next week, it won’t be a
bit the same thing if——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly the Dorrington girls together—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mrs. Maradick—good-bye—ripping—awfully
sorry——” the rest lost in nervous laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then began that last dreadful minute when you do
so wish in spite of yourself that the train would go. You
have said your last words, you have given your last embrace,
and you stare passionately down the platform hoping for that
final whistle and the splendid waving of a green flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last it came. The ladies surged forward in a body and
waved their handkerchiefs. Mrs. Maradick leaned for a
moment out of the window and waved hers. Tom Craddock
shouted something hoarsely about James that no one could
hear, and Epsom was finally bereft of its glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick collected her bags with her rugs, and then
considered her girls. They were seated quietly, each in a
corner, their faces bent studiously over their magazines.
They were very much alike, with straight flaxen hair and pink
and white complexions, light blue cotton frocks, and dark
green waistbands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, they were nice girls—they were dear girls. Then she
thought of her husband. James Maradick had stood in the
background during the farewells. He had, indeed, been busy
up to the very last moment, but he was a reserved and silent
man, and he really hadn’t anything very much to say. He
was well over six feet, and broad in proportion. He was
clean shaven, with features very strongly marked, and a
high forehead from which the hair, closely cut and a little
grey at the temples, was brushed back and parted on the right
side. His eyes were grey and, at times, wonderfully expressive.
Epsom said that he was a dreadful man for looking
you through. He wore a suit of dark brown excellently
cut. He was sitting now opposite his wife and looking out
of the window. He was thinking of Tom Craddock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James dear, where is my book? You know—that novel
you gave me—‘Sir Somebody or other’s heir’ or something.
I just like to know where everything is before I settle down.
It was really awfully nice of Louie Denis coming all that
way to say good-bye—and of the others too. I wonder Jack
Hearne wasn’t there. He could have seen Louie back, and
it would have been a good chance; but perhaps he didn’t
know she was coming. It was nice of Mr. Craddock coming
up, though of course he came to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused for a denial, but he didn’t say anything, so she
went on—“But, poor fellow, he’s getting dreadfully fat.
I wonder whether he couldn’t take something for it—baths
or something—though of course exercise is the thing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked up. “Yes, poor old Tom. He’s a good
chap. But he’s getting on—we’re all getting on. I shall
be stout soon—not as young as we were——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, James. I’m sure you haven’t altered a bit
since you were twenty. Mr. Craddock was always stout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned back and put her hand to her forehead. “This
train does shake most dreadfully. I’m going to have one
of those horrible headaches again. I can feel it coming.
Just look for my smelling-salts, will you? I think they are
in that little black handbag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, wise through much experience, soon found what she
wanted, settled cushions at her back, drew the blind down
the window to keep the sun from her eyes, and then sank
back into his seat again and watched the country flash past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How many holidays had there been before exactly like
this one? He could not count them. There had always
been people to see them off—people who had said the same
things, made the same jokes, smiled and laughed in the same
way. There had always been the same hurried breakfast,
the agitated drive, the crowded station, the counting of
boxes. There had not, of course, been always the girls;
there had been a nurse, and they had travelled in another
carriage because the noise troubled his wife. His wife!
He looked at her now as she lay back against her cushions
with her eyes closed. She had changed very little during
all those married years; she was still the same dainty, pretty
little woman—something delicate and fragile—whom he had
loved so passionately fifteen years before. He thought
of those years before he had met her. They had been exciting,
adventurous years. Whenever he went out, were
it only to pay a call, there had been always the thought that
now, perhaps, at last, he was to meet that wonderful Fate
that was waiting somewhere for him. He had often thought
that he had met it. He remembered Miss Suckling, a pretty
girl, a parson’s daughter, and then Lucy Armes with her
wonderful dark hair and glorious eyes, and then little Rose
Craven—yes, he had loved her pretty badly, only some one
else had stepped in and carried her off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then at last his Fate had come; there had been a
delirious courting, a glorious proposal, a rapturous engagement,
and a wonderful wedding. It was all so swift and so
exciting that he had not had time to think about it at all.
The world had seemed a very wonderful, glowing place then,
and he had wondered why people thought that rapture faded
and gave place to other feelings—mistrust and criticism
and then estrangement. He remembered the wonderful letters
that he had written, and the sealing of them with great
blots of red sealing-wax—every night he had written. On
looking back, it seemed that he had done most of the wooing;
she had been very charming and dainty and delightful,
but she had taken things very quietly and soberly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now? He looked at her again, and then out of the
window. Nothing had happened, of course. He could look
to no definite act or event and point to it as the dividing
line. He had discovered very quickly that she had nothing
to give him, that there was no question, nor indeed could
ever be, of partnership or companionship. That, of course,
had been at first. He had put it down to his own stupidity,
his ignorance, his blindness; but he had tried her on every
side, he had yielded her every allowance, and there was
nothing there, simply nothing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he had discovered another thing. She had not
married him for himself, nor indeed, to do her justice, for
his position or anything material that he could give her,
but simply that she might have children. He did not know
how he had discovered this, but he had known it by the end
of the first year of their life together, and then, as their
girls had grown, he had seen it increasingly plainly. Any
other man would have done equally well—some men might
have done better—and so he had done his duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, when he saw what had happened and that there
was an end to his dreams, he had set his teeth and given his
soul for the making of money. Whether it had been a fair
exchange he did not know, but he had succeeded. They
had plenty—plenty for the present, plenty for the future.
He need not do another day’s work all his life unless he
wished, and he was only forty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled grimly as he looked out of the window. He
did not whine or complain. There were doubtless thousands
and thousands of other people in the same case—only,
what a muddle! what a silly, hideous muddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was forty, and in perfect health. He looked at his
wife again. She was happy enough; she had her house
and her friends and her girls! She did not want anything
at all. And they would go on, of course, to the end of
things like that. For years now it had been the same
thing. He had played the game, and she had never guessed
that he wanted anything; she had probably never thought
about him at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was forty, and life was over—its adventures, its emotions,
its surprises, its vices, its great romance; he was a
bird in a cage, and he had put himself inside and locked
the door. He looked at his girls; they aroused no emotion
whatever, he did not care for them at all. That was wrong,
of course, but it was quite true; and then it was equally
true that they didn’t care for him. His head began to nod,
and at last he was asleep. He was dreaming of the station
and poor Tom Craddock—he grew fatter and fatter—he
filled the carriage—everyone had to squeeze against the wall
to get out of his way—Tom, Tom—this won’t do, really—have
some consideration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was perfect silence in the carriage. The girls had
not spoken a word since the journey began. The shining
landscape flew past them; things darted up at the window;
cows and trees and hedges and telegraph wires leapt wildly
up and down for no apparent reason whatever. At last
an official arrived and commanded them to take their places
for lunch, and there was instant confusion. Mrs. Maradick
sailed into the dining-car followed closely by her girls;
Maradick brought up the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sleep had refreshed her, and she was bright and
amusing. “Now, James, look your brightest. Well, Annie
darling, and was the <span class='it'>Girl’s Realm</span> amusing? Yes? I’m
so glad, and what was the thing that you liked best?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annie spoke softly and deliberately. “There was a story,
mother, about a girl’s adventures in America that I liked
rather, also an article on ‘How to learn the Violin’ was
very good.” She folded her hands on her lap and looked
straight in front of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Maradick was deep in the menu. “It’s always
roast mutton or boiled lamb,” she exclaimed; “I never knew
anything so monotonous—and cheese <span class='it'>or</span> sweet”—she dived
into her soup with relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really not so bad,” she cried a little later. “And
they do have the things hot, which is so important. Think,
girls, we’re half-way already. We’ll be in splendid time
for dinner. I wonder who’ll be there this year. There
were those nice Jacksons last year—you remember—that
Miss Jackson with the fuzzy hair and the short skirt—quite
nice people, they were. I don’t think you took to
them much, James.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t care very much about them,” he replied
grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—such a pity. We so often like different people.
And then there were the Dalrymples—quite nice—and
Lucy Dalrymple was such a good friend for the girls; you
remember Lucy, don’t you, dears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was to be the same thing again—the same
monotonous round that it had been before. He had liked
Treliss at first. It had been quaint, romantic, interesting,
and he had loved the sea. And then the hotel with its
quaint name, “The Man at Arms,” and its picturesque
Elizabethan architecture. If he could be there alone, just
for a day!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went back to their carriage, and found that the
two extra seats, tenanted hitherto by a man and his wife
who were negligible from every point of view, were now
occupied by two very young people. A further glance classified
them as “honeymooners,” and Mrs. Maradick found
them no longer interesting. She sank into her novel, and
there was absolute stillness save for the soft whirr of the
wheels beneath them and the rush of the air outside the
windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The couple opposite him were very quiet—sometimes
there was a whisper or a laugh as their eyes met. He knew
that look in the eyes and that clasp of the hand. He knew
that they were, both of them, outside the train, flying
through space, without thought of time or any confining
boundaries. What fools they were; he would like to tell
them so. He would like to show them that he had been
like that once, fifteen years before. He had thought that
there would never be an end to it, and it had lasted barely
a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so they passed into Cornwall. Every year at that
moment there came the same strange thrill, the same emotion
as of something ancient and immutable crossing the
very modern and changing texture of his own life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick put down her novel and looked about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will soon be Truro,” she said; “and then there’ll be
all that troublesome changing at Trewth. It’s really too
absurd that one should have that all the time. Dear Louie!
I wonder what she’s doing now—gone to look at the garden,
I expect, like the dear girl she is. I hope they will give
us the same rooms again this year. You wrote for them,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you know last year they tried to put those
stupid Jones’s in, and if I hadn’t made quite a row about
it they’d have turned us into the east wing with that
great dreary sweep of sea and not a glimpse of the town in
front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered that he had rather envied those rooms
in front; there had been a magnificent view of the sea,
and a little corner with an old greystone pier and red fishing-boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick turned her attention to the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, dears, come and talk.” They moved towards her,
and sat one on each side, expectant. “I had your reports,
dears, just before I left home, and they were both most satisfactory.
Miss Maynard says about your French, Isabel,
that you show some ability and great diligence. Which was
Miss Maynard, dear, at the prize-giving? That nice-looking
girl with that rather smart frock? I remember noticing her
at the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mother, that was Miss Lane; Miss Maynard had
pince-nez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; and beat time to the songs, I remember. As
for the arithmetic——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched them, and knew that he had been forgotten
altogether. Were other people’s children like that? He
knew some little girls who climbed on to their father’s knee,
and pulled his moustache and clutched his hand; but then,
it must be largely his own fault, because he knew that if
his girls had tried to do that he would have prevented them.
He should not have known what to say!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a wonderful glow over the land as they came
into Trewth. Already he felt the breath of the sea and the
salt sting in the air; down the long platform the winds came
laughing and screaming round the boxes and the bundles
and the absurd mortals who clung to their hats and cloaks
and neatly bound hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, girls.” Mrs. Maradick collared her porter
and shouted “Treliss!” into his ear. “Don’t forget anything,
James. Have you my green bag and the little brown
holdall? and—oh, yes—my black bag there on the seat.”
She hurried down the platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was always at this moment that a general review took
place, and you discovered whether there was going to be
anyone you knew at Treliss. Everyone was waiting for the
other train to come in, so that you had a splendid time for
inspection. Mrs. Maradick was an adept at the difficult art
of knowing all about people in half a minute without looking
anywhere near them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the Dalrymples aren’t there. I dare say they’ve
come already. What a wind! Really, it’s most annoying
having to wait. James, have you got all the boxes
there? Twelve altogether, counting that portmanteau of
yours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was looking very pretty indeed, her colour heightened
by the wind, her hair blowing in little golden whisps about
her cheek, the light green of her dress, and the little jingle
of gold bracelets, and the pearl necklace at her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked up and down the platform silently until the
train came in. They never talked when they were together
because there was nothing to say. When other people were
there they kept it up because they had to play a game, but
when they were alone it really wasn’t worth while. He
wondered sometimes whether she realised that he was there
at all. He would have liked to make her angry; he had
tried once, but it was no good, she only smiled and stared
through him as though he had been a brick wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got into the train and sped on that fairy-journey to
Treliss. It was always the most magical thing in the world.
The trains helped to add to the romance of it—strange lumbering,
stumbling carriages with a ridiculous little engine
that shrieked for no reason and puffed and snorted in order
to increase its own importance. They often stopped suddenly
while something was put right; and they would lie
there, for several minutes, in the heart of the golden sand
with the blue sea smiling below. He was often tempted to
get out and strike across the green dunes, and so down into
the heart of the little town with its red roofs and shining
spires. He caught the gleam of the wet sand, and he saw
the red-brown outline of the rocks as they rounded the curve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That platform was crowded, and he had some difficulty
in securing a cab; but they were settled at last, and turned
the corner down the cobbled street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick lay back quite exhausted. “We’d never
have got that cab if I hadn’t held on to that man’s arm,”
she said breathlessly. “It was positively the last, and we
should have had to wait at that station hours before we got
another. I call it regular bad management. It’s the most
important train in the day and they ought to have had plenty
of things to meet it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Treliss has not, as yet, been spoiled by the demands of
modern civilisation. “Touristy” it is in August, and the
“Man at Arms” is one of the most popular hotels in the
West of England; but it has managed to keep undefiled its
delightfully narrow streets, its splendidly insufficient shops,
its defective lighting, and a quite triumphant lack of competition.
Its main street runs steeply up the hill, having its
origin in the wet, gleaming sands of the little bay and its
triumphant conclusion in the splendid portals and shining
terraces of the “Man at Arms.” The street is of cobbles,
and the houses still hang over it with crooked doorposts and
bending gables, so that the Middle Ages stalks by your side
as you go, and you expect some darkly cloaked figure to point
menacingly with bony fingers up the dark alleys and twisting
corners. There are shops of a kind along the way, but no
one has ever taken them seriously. “You can buy nothing
in Treliss” is the constant cry of all visitors; and it is generally
followed by the assertion that you have to pay double
West End prices all the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancient four-wheeler containing the Maradicks
bumped slowly up the hill, and at every moment it seemed
as though the avalanche of boxes on the top must come down
with a rush and a roar and scatter their contents over the
cobbles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick said nothing, her mind was fixed on the
forthcoming interview with her hotel manager. She would
have to fight for those rooms, she knew, but she would win
her victory and give no quarter. The charm of the place
had caught Maradick once more in its arms. In the dust
and heat of the London year he had thought that he had
lost it altogether; but now, with a glimpse of the curving
bay and the cobbled street, with that scent of spray and
onions and mignonette and fishing-nets (it was compounded
of all those things) in his nostrils, his heart was beating excitedly,
and he was humming a little tune that he had heard
the year before. What was the tune? He had forgotten
it; he had never thought of it in London, but now it was
with him again. He had heard a sailor sing it in an inn
on the quay. He had stood outside in the dusk and listened.
He remembered the last line:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>And there’s gold in the creek and the sands of the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So ho! for the smuggler’s cargo!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It meant nothing, of course—a kind of “Pirates of Penzance”
absurdity—but the little tune was beating in his
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-way up the hill there is the market-place, standing
on a raised plateau as it were, with the town-hall as its central
glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove through with difficulty, because there was a
fair that filled the market and overflowed into the crooked
streets up and down the hill. They only caught a passing
glimpse as they bumped and stumbled through: a merry-go-round
and rows of booths and shouting crowds of men
and girls, and a strange toothless old woman in a peaked
hat seated on a barrel and selling sweets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How they can allow it I don’t know!” Mrs. Maradick
leant back from the window. “One might as well—Whitechapel,
you know, and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last turn of the road to the hotel was very steep indeed,
and the weight of the boxes seemed to accumulate with
every step; the horses strained and tugged, and for a moment
they hesitated and half slid backward, then with a hoarse
shout from the driver, a gigantic straining of limb and
muscle, they were through the hotel gates. For the hotel
stands in its own grounds, and, as you approach it up a
drive of larch and birch, its privacy is startling and unusual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One hundred years before it had been the manor of the
estate, the feudal castle of a feudal town, ruling, like some
Italian despot, the country at its feet. Then its masters had
fallen at the feet of the Juggernaut of modern civilisation
and improvement, and their tyranny had passed into the
hands of others. For some years the house had lain desolate
and threatened to fall into utter ruin and decay; its
gardens had been transformed into a wilderness, and its
rooms had gathered dust and mildew into their quarters.
Then in 1850 or thereabouts young Mr. Bannister of Manchester
had seen his chance. Treliss, at that time, was an
obscure and minute village of no fame whatever; but it had
fishing, colour and bathing, so Mr. Bannister seized his opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had large resources at his back and a very original
brain at his service, so he set to work and was immediately
successful. He had no intention of turning it into a modern
watering-place—there was enough of that (speaking now
of 1860) to be done elsewhere—he had Pendragon and Port
Looth in his mind. No, he would let it keep its character—indeed,
he would force it to keep its character. For some
years there were other things to do and his plans were still
in embryo; then in 1870 (no longer young Mr. Bannister,
but stout and prosperous Mr. Bannister) he took the house
in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He interfered in no way with its original character.
There were a great many alterations, of course, but, through
it all, it retained that seventeenth-century charm and spaciousness—that
air of surprise and unexpected corners,
the sudden visions of hidden gardens bordered by close-clipped
box and the broad depths of wide stone staircases
and dark oak panelling—a charm that was to be found in no
other hotel in England, a delicious survival that gave you
seventeenth-century England without any of its discomforts
and drawbacks, sanitary or otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For now, in 1908, it had all the very latest improvements.
There were lifts, and the very best methods of ventilation;
the electric light was of a delicious softness, and carpets and
chairs were so luxurious that it was difficult to force oneself
outside. But then, when you were outside, you wondered
how you could ever stay in; for there were lawns with the
most wonderful views of the sea and tennis and croquet and
badminton and—and now the Maradicks were at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were several people scattered about the grounds
who watched them with curiosity; but it was nearly dressing-time,
and already the shadows were lengthening over the
lawns and the yews flung long fantastic shapes over the roses
and pinks. There was a little breeze in the tops of the
trees, and very faintly, like some distant solemn music, came
the roll of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doors closed on the Maradicks.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch03'>CHAPTER III</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>IN WHICH THE ADMONITUS LOCORUM BEGINS TO HAVE FUN</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>WITH TWO ENTIRELY RESPECTABLE MEMBERS OF</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>SOCIETY</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hall of the “Man at Arms” was ever a place of mystery.
The high roof seemed to pass into infinite space,
and on every side there appeared passages and dark oaken
doors that led, one fancied, into the very heart of secrecy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the other end, opposite to the great doors, was the wide
stone staircase leading to other floors, and down the passages
to right and left deep-set windows let in shafts of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick greeted Mr. Bannister cordially, but with
reserve. He was a little stout man like a top, scrupulously
neat and always correct. He liked to convey to his guests
the spirit of the place—that they were received from no
mercenary point of view, but rather with the greeting of a
friend. Of course, there would ultimately be a bill—it was
only the horrid necessity of these, our grasping times—but
let it be forgotten and put aside until the final leave-taking.
He would have preferred, if possible, to send bills afterwards
by post, directed by another hand; but that gave opportunity
to unscrupulous adventurers. He would have
liked to have entertained the whole world, at any rate the
whole social world, free of charge; as it was—well, the bills
were heavy. He was always disappointed when his guests
failed to grasp this point of view; sometimes they were blustering
and domineering, sometimes they were obsequious and
timorous—either manner was disagreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About Mrs. Maradick he was never quite sure. He was
afraid that she scarcely grasped the whole situation; there
was no doubt that she found it impossible to eliminate the
bill altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And our rooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick looked up at him. She was smiling, but
it was a smile that threatened to disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you will be completely satisfied, Mrs. Maradick.
A most delightful suite on the second floor with a view of the
sea——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—but our rooms. My husband wrote, I think. We
had the same last year—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid that there’s been a little difficulty. We had
had previous orders. I would have written to explain had
I not been sure that the rooms that we had allotted you
would be completely satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Bannister, that is too bad of you.” The
smile had gone and her eyes flashed. There was to be a
battle as she had foreseen. “We had the same trouble last
year, I think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am extremely sorry, Mrs. Maradick.” He watched her
a little anxiously. This was one of the occasions on which
he was not certain of her. Would she remember the true
ethics of the situation? He hoped for her sake that she
would. “I am really very sorry, but I am afraid in this
case that there is nothing to be done. Sir Richard and
Lady Gale ordered the rooms so long ago as last Christmas.
It is of some importance to him, I believe, owing to reasons
of health. They laid some stress on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Gale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Mr. Bannister smiled again. “Really, Mrs.
Maradick, I think that you would be perfectly satisfied with
your rooms if you would come up for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Lady Gale here?” Mrs. Maradick was considering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. They arrived last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” this slowly and with hesitation, “let us go and
see them, James. One never knows, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick was relieved. He always waited in the background
during these interviews—there were many throughout
the year. But this was delightfully over. Had it been
the Jones’s! Well, he had no doubt that it would have
been a prolonged struggle; after all, there <span class='it'>was</span> a difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick hurried to the lift, her girls in close attendance,
and Mr. Bannister at her side. Maradick was
about to follow, when he felt a touch on his elbow and turned
round. At his side stood a young man with dark curly hair
and a snub nose; not snub enough to mind, but just enough
to give you the impression that “everything turned up”—the
corners of his mouth and the tips of his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed very young indeed, and had that very clean,
clear skin that is the best thing in a decent young man; at
least, that is more or less how Maradick summed him up.
He was in evening dress, and it suited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, I’m most awfully sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was smiling, so Maradick smiled too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the rooms, you know. It is my people—my name
is Gale—who have them. I’m afraid it was most annoying,
and I’m sure my mother will be extremely sorry.” He
blushed and stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please——” Maradick felt quite embarrassed.
“It really doesn’t matter at all. My wife liked those rooms—we
were there last year—and she’s naturally asked about
them; but these others will suit us splendidly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but your being there last year seems almost as
though you had a right, doesn’t it? It is true about my
father, it makes rather a difference to him, and they are
ripping rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course,” Maradick laughed again, “we shall be
perfectly comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s pause. There was nothing more
to say: then suddenly, simultaneously—“It’s very decent
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and at that they laughed again. Then Maradick
hurried up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy stayed where he was, the smile lingering at the
corners of his mouth. Although it was half-past seven the
daylight streamed into the hall. People were passing to
and fro, and every now and again glanced at him and caught
his infectious smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, a pretty woman, but a bit of a Tartar,” he
said, thinking of Mrs. Maradick; then he turned round and
walked up the stairs, down a passage to the right, and in
a moment young Gale had opened their sitting-room door.
The rooms under discussion were certainly very delightful
and the view was charming, down over the town and out to
the sea beyond. There were glimpses of the crooked streets
and twisted gables, and, at last, the little stone pier and a
crowd of herring-boats sheltering under its protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the sitting-room was Lady Gale, waiting to go down
to dinner. At this time she was about fifty years of age, but
she was straight and tall as she had been at twenty. In
her young days as Miss Laurence, daughter of Sir Douglas
Laurence, the famous Egyptologist, she had been a beauty,
and she was magnificent now with a mass of snow-white hair
that, piled high on her head, seemed a crown worthily bestowed
on her as one of the best and gentlest women of her
generation; but perhaps it was her eyes that made you conscious
at once of being in the presence of some one whose
judgment was unswerving with a tenderness of compassion
that made her the confidante of all the failures and wastrels
of her day. “Lady Gale will tell you that you are wrong,”
some one once said of her; “but she will tell you so
that her condemnation is better than another person’s
praise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At her side stood a man of about thirty, strikingly resembling
her in many ways, but lacking in animation and intelligence.
You felt that his carefully controlled moustache
was the most precious thing about him, and that the cut of
his clothes was of more importance than the cut of his character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tony?” Lady Gale greeted him as he closed the
door behind him. “Getting impatient? Father isn’t ready.
I told him that we’d wait for him; and Alice hasn’t appeared——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not a bit.” He came over to her and put his hand
on her shoulder. “I’m not hungry, as a matter of fact, too
big a tea. Besides, where’s Alice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming. She told us not to wait, but I suppose we’d
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say! Mother! I’ve discovered the most awfully
decent fellow downstairs, really; I hope that we shall get
to know him. He looks a most thundering good sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red light from the setting sun had caught the church
spire and the roofs of the market-place; the town seemed
on fire; the noise of the fair came discordantly up to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another of your awfully decent chaps!” This from
his brother. “My dear Tony, you discover a new one every
week. Only I wish you wouldn’t thrust them on to us.
What about the charming painter who borrowed your links
and never returned them, and that delightful author-fellow
who was so beastly clever that he had to fly the country——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, chuck it, Rupert. Of course one makes mistakes.
I learnt a lot from Allison, and I know he always meant to
send the links back and forgot; anyhow he’s quite welcome
to them. But this chap’s all right—he is really—he looks
jolly decent——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but, Tony,” said his mother, laughing, “I agree
with Rupert there. Make your odd acquaintances if you
like, but don’t bring them down on to us; for instance,
that horrid little fat man you liked so much at one time, the
poet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Trelawny. He’s all right now. He’s going to do
great things one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And meanwhile borrows money that he never intends
to repay. No, Tony, these sudden acquaintances are generally
a mistake, take my word for it. How long have you
known this man downstairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a minute. He’s just arrived with his wife and
two little girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you know him already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see his wife wanted these rooms—said she
ordered them or something—and then went for old Bannister
about it, and he, naturally enough, said that we’d got
them; and then he stuck it on about their rooms and said
that they were much the nicest rooms in the place, and then
she went off fairly quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where did the man come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t at all, and, from the look of her, I shouldn’t
think that he ever does. But I went up and said I was
jolly sorry, and all that sort of thing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m——!” from Rupert. “Really, Tony!
And what on earth was there to apologise for! If we are
going to start saying pretty things to everyone in the hotel
who wants these rooms we’ve got our work cut out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I didn’t say pretty things; I don’t know why I
really said anything at all. The spirit moved me, I suppose.
I’m going to be friends with that man. I shall like
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By three infallible signs. He looks you straight in the
eyes, he’s got a first-class laugh, and he doesn’t say much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Characteristics of most of the scoundrels in the kingdom,”
Rupert said, yawning. “By Jove! I wish father
and Alice would hurry up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl came in at that moment; Tony danced round her
and then caught her hand and led her to his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Majesty! I have the honour of presenting her
Grace the Duchess of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl broke from him. “Don’t, Tony, please,
you’re upsetting things. Please, Lady Gale, can’t we go
down? I’m so hungry that no ordinary dinner will ever
satisfy me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you pretend, Alice,” cried Tony, laughing. “It’s
the dress, the whole dress, and nothing but the dress. That
we may astonish this our town of Treliss is our earnest and
most humble desire.” He stopped. “It is high time, you
know, mother; nearly half-past eight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, but it’s your father. You might go and see if
he’s nearly ready, Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he moved across the room her eyes followed him with
a devotion that was the most beautiful thing in the world.
Then she turned to the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Alice Du Cane was looking very lovely indeed. Her
dress was something wonderful in pink, and that was all
that the ordinary observer would have discovered about it;
very beautiful and soft, tumbling into all manner of lines
and curves and shades as she walked. Quite one of the
beauties of the season, Miss Alice Du Cane, and one of the
loveliest visions that your dining-halls are likely to behold,
Mr. Bannister! She was dark and tall and her smile was
delightful—just a little too obviously considered, perhaps,
but nevertheless delightful!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, you look very nice.” Lady Gale smiled at
her. “I only wish that all young ladies nowadays would
be content to dress as simply; but, of course, they haven’t all
got your natural advantages!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the door opened once more and Sir Richard Gale
appeared, followed closely by Tony. He was a man of magnificent
presence and wonderful preservation, and he was
probably the most completely selfish egoist in the kingdom;
on these two facts he had built his reputation. The first
gave him many admirers and the second gave him many enemies,
and a splendid social distinction was the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was remarkably handsome, in a military-cum-Embassy
manner; that is, his moustache, his walk, and the swing
of his shoulders were all that they should be. He walked
across the room most beautifully, but, perhaps, just a little
too carefully, so that he gave the onlooker the impression of
something rather precariously kept together—it was the only
clue to his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spent his life in devising means of enabling his wife
to give sign and evidence to the world of her affection. He
was entirely capricious and unreliable, and took violent dislikes
to very many different kinds of people. He had always
been a very silent man, and now his conversation was limited
to monosyllables; he disliked garrulous persons, but expected
conversation to be maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only thing that he said now was “Dinner!” but
everyone knew what he meant, and an advance was made:
Lady Gale and her husband, Miss Du Cane between Rupert
and Tony, accompanied by laughter and a good deal of wild
jesting on the part of the last named.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The going in to dinner at home was always a most solemn
affair, even when no one save the family were present.
Sir Richard was seen at his best in the minutes during which
the procession lasted, and it symbolised the dignity and
solemnity befitting his place and family. The Gales go in
to dinner! and then, Sir Richard Gale goes in to dinner!—it
was the moment of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now how greatly was the symbolism increased. Here
we are in the heart of the democracy, sitting down with our
fellow-creatures, some of whom are most certainly commoners,
sitting down without even a raised platform; not at the
same table, it is true, but nevertheless on the same floor, beneath
the same ceiling! It was indeed a wonderful and
truly British ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He generally contrived to be a little late, but to-day they
were very late indeed, and his shoulders were raised just a
little higher and his head was just a little loftier than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was full, and many heads were raised as they
entered. They were a fine family, no doubt—Sir Richard,
Lady Gale, Rupert—all distinguished and people at whom
one looked twice, and then Alice was lovely. It was only
Tony, perhaps, who might have been anybody; just a nice
clean-looking boy people were inclined to call him, but they
always liked him. Their table was at the other end of the
room, and the procession was slow. Tony always hated it—“making
a beastly monkey-show of oneself and the family”—but
his father took his time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was charming, with just a little touch of something
unusual. Mr. Bannister liked flowers, but he was wise
in his use of them; and every table had just that hint of
colour, red and blue and gold, that was needed, without any
unnecessary profusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were a great many people—the season was at its
height—and the Maradicks, although late, were fortunate
to have secured a table by the windows. The girls were
tired and were going to have supper in bed—a little fish,
some chicken and some shape—Mrs. Maradick had given
careful directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the windows came the scents of the garden and
a tiny breeze that smelt of the sea. There were wonderful
colours on the lawn outside. The moon was rising, a full
moon like a stiff plate of old gold, and its light flung shadows
and strange twisted shapes over the grass. The trees
stood, tall and dark, a mysterious barrier that fluttered and
trembled in the little wind and was filled with the whispers
of a thousand voices. Beyond that again was the light pale
quivering blue of the night-sky, in which flashed and wheeled
and sparkled the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Maradick were playing the game very thoroughly
to-night; you could not have found a more devoted
couple in the room. She looked charming in her fragile,
kittenish manner, something fluffy and white and apparently
simple, with a slender chain of gold at her throat and a
small spray of diamonds in her hair. She was excited, too,
by the place and the people and the whole change. This was,
oh! most certainly! better than Epsom, and Mrs. Martin
Fraser and Louie had faded into a very distant past. This
was her métier!—this, with its lights and its fashion! Why
didn’t they live in London, really in London? She must
persuade James next year. It would be better for the girls,
too, now that they were growing up; and they might even
find somewhere with a garden. She chattered continuously
and watched for the effect on her neighbours. She had noticed
one man whisper, and several people had looked across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so wonderful that I’m not more tired after all that
bolting and jolting, and you know I felt that headache coming
all the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only just kept it at bay. But really,
now, I’m quite hungry; it’s strange. I never could eat anything
in Epsom. What is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter handed her the card. She looked up at him
with a smile. “Oh! no consommé! thank you. Yes, Filet
de sole and Poularde braisée—oh! and Grouse à la broche—of
course—just in time, James, to-day’s only the fifteenth.
Cerises Beatrice—Friandises—oh! delightful! the very
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bannister knows what to give us,” he said, turning to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She settled back in her seat with a little purr of pleasure.
“I hope the girls had what they wanted. Little dears! I’m
afraid they were dreadfully tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her curiously. There had been so many
evenings like this—evenings when those around him would
have counted him a lucky fellow; and yet he knew that he
might have been a brick wall and she would have talked in
the same way. He judged her by her eyes—eyes that looked
through him, past him, quite coldly, with no expression and
no emotion. She simply did not realise that he was there,
and he suddenly felt cold and miserable and very lonely.
Oh! if only these people round him knew, if they could only
see as he saw. But perhaps they were, many of them, in
the same position. He watched them curiously. Men and
women laughing and chatting with that intimate note that
seemed to mean so much and might, as he knew well, mean
so little. Everybody seemed very happy; perhaps they were.
Oh! he was an old, middle-aged marplot, a kill-joy, a skeleton
at the feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it jolly, dear?” he said, laughing across the table;
“this grouse is perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” she said, with that little wave of her wrist towards
him that he knew so well—“tell me where the Gales
are. I don’t suppose you know, though, but we might guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do know,” he answered, laughing; “young Gale came
and spoke to me just before I came up to dress. He seemed
a nice young fellow. He came up and said something about
the rooms—he had heard you speaking to Bannister. They
came in just now; a fine-looking elderly man, a lady with
beautiful white hair, a pretty girl in pink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! of course! I noticed them! Oh, yes! one could
tell they were somebody.” She glanced round the room.
“Yes, there they are, by the wall at the back; quite a lovely
girl!” She looked at them curiously. “Oh, you spoke
to young Gale, did you? He looks quite a nice boy. I hope
they have liked the rooms, and, after all, ours aren’t bad, are
they? Really, I’m not sure that in some ways——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rattled on, praising the grouse, the bread sauce, the
vegetables. She speculated on people and made little jokes
about them, and he threw the ball back again, gaily, merrily,
light-heartedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I don’t think Louie really cares about him.
I often hoped for her sake, poor girl, that she did, because
there’s no denying that she’s getting on; and it isn’t as if
she’s got looks or money, and it’s a wonder that he’s stuck to
her as he has. I’ve always said that Louie was a marrying
woman and she’d make him a good wife, there’s no doubt
of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her little eyes were glittering like diamonds and her
cheeks were hot. People were arriving at the fruit stage,
and conversation, which had murmured over the soup and
hummed over the meat, seemed to Maradick to shriek over the
grapes and pears. How absurd it all was, and what was the
matter with him? His head was aching, and the silver and
flowers danced before his eyes. The great lines of the silver
birch were purple over the lawn and the full moon was level
with the windows. It must have been the journey, and he
had certainly worked very hard these last months in town;
but he had never known his nerves like they were to-night,
indeed he had often wondered whether he had any nerves at
all. Now they were all on the jump; just as though, you
know, you were on one of those roundabouts, the horses
jumping up and down and round, and the lights and the
other people jumping too. There was a ridiculous man at a
table close to them with a bald head, and the electric light
caught it and turned it into a fiery ball. Such a bald head!
It shone like the sun, and he couldn’t take his eyes away
from it: and still his wife went on talking, talking, talking—that
same little laugh, that gesticulating with the fingers,
that glance round to see whether people had noticed. In
some of those first years he had tried to make her angry,
had contradicted and laughed derisively, but it had had no
effect. She simply hadn’t considered him. But she <span class='it'>must</span>
consider him! It was absurd; they were husband and wife.
He had said—what had he said that first day in church?
He couldn’t remember, but he knew that she ought to consider
him, that she oughtn’t to look past him like that just
as though he wasn’t there. He pulled himself together with
a great effort and finished the champagne in his glass: the
waiter filled it again; then he leant back in his chair and
began to peel an apple, but his fingers were trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That woman over there,” said Mrs. Maradick, addressing
a table to her right and then glancing quickly to her
left, “is awfully like Mrs. Newton Bassett—the same sort
of hair, and she’s got the eyes. Captain Bassett’s coming
home in the autumn, I believe, which will be rather a blow
for Muriel Bassett if all they say is true. He’s been out
in Central Africa or somewhere, hasn’t he? Years older
than her, they say, and as ugly as—Oh, well! people do talk,
but young Forrest has been in there an awful lot lately, and
he’s as nice a young fellow as you’d want to meet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He couldn’t stand it much longer, so he put the apple
down on his plate and finished the champagne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I went out to Central Africa,” he said slowly, “I
wonder whether——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These pears are delicious,” she answered, still looking
at the table to her left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I went out to Central Africa——” he said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant forward and played with the silver in front of
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, I want you to listen.” He leant forward
towards her so that he might escape the man with the bald
head. “If I went out to Central Africa, you—well, you
wouldn’t much mind, would you? Things would be very
much the same. It’s rather comforting to think that you
wouldn’t very much mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick’s hands were shaking, but he spoke quite calmly,
and he did not raise his voice because he did not want the
man with the bald head to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t mind, would you? Why don’t you say?”
Then suddenly something seemed to turn in his brain, like
a little wheel, and it hurt. “It’s been going on like this for
years, and how long do you think I’m going to stand it?
You don’t care at all. I’m just like a chair, a table, anything.
I say it’s got to change—I’ll turn you out—won’t
have anything more to do with you—you’re not a wife at all—a
man expects——” He did not know what he was saying,
and he did not really very much care. He could not
be eloquent or dramatic about it like people were in books,
because he wasn’t much of a talker, and there was that little
wheel in his head, and all these people talking. It had all
happened in the very briefest of moments. He hardly realised
at the time at all, but afterwards the impression that
he had of it was of his fingers grating on the table-cloth;
they dug into the wood of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For only a moment his fingers seemed, of their own accord,
to rise from the table and stretch out towards her throat.
Sheer animal passion held him, passion born of her placidity
and indifference. Then suddenly he caught her eyes; she
was looking at him, staring at him, her face was very white,
and he had never seen anyone look so frightened. And then
all his rage left him and he sat back in his chair again,
shaking from head to foot. There were all those years between
them and he had never said a word until now! Then
he felt horribly ashamed of himself; he had been intolerably
rude, to a lady. He wasn’t quite certain of what he had
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” he said slowly, “I have been very
rude. I didn’t quite know what I was saying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment they were silent. The chatter went on,
and the waiter was standing a little way away; he had not
heard anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am rather tired,” said Mrs. Maradick; “I think I’ll
go up, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and offered her his arm, and they went out together.
She did not look at him, and neither of them spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony Gale was absurdly excited that evening, and even
his father’s presence scarcely restrained him. Sir Richard
never said very much, but he generally looked a great deal;
to-night he enjoyed his dinner. Lady Gale watched Tony
a little anxiously. She had always been the wisest of mothers
in that she had never spoken before her time; the whole
duty of parents lies in the inviting of their children’s confidence
by never asking for it, and she had never asked. Then
she had met Miss Alice Du Cane and had liked her, and it
had struck her that here was the very girl for Tony. Tony
liked her and she liked Tony. In every way it seemed a
thing to be desired, and this invitation to accompany them
to Cornwall was a natural move in the right direction. They
were both, of course, very young; but then people did begin
very young nowadays, and Tony had been “down” from
Oxford a year and ought to know what he was about. Alice
was a charming girl, and the possessor of much sound common-sense;
indeed, there was just the question whether she
hadn’t got a little too much. The Du Canes were excellently
connected; on the mother’s side there were the Forestiers
of Portland Hall down in Devon, and the Craddocks of Newton
Chase—oh! that was all right. And then Tony had a
fortune of his own, so that he was altogether independent,
and one couldn’t be quite sure of what he would do, so that
it was a satisfaction to think that he really cared for somebody
that so excellently did! It promised to be a satisfactory
affair all round, and even Sir Richard, a past master
in the art of finding intricate objections to desirable plans,
had nothing to say. Of course, it was a matter that needed
looking at from every point of view. Of the Du Canes,
there were not many. Colonel Du Cane had died some years
before, and Lady Du Cane, a melancholy, faded lady who
passed her time in such wildly exciting health-resorts as
Baden-Baden and Marienbad, had left her daughter to the
care of her aunt, Miss Perryn. There <span class='it'>were</span> other Du Canes,
a brother at Eton and a sister in France, but they were too
young to matter; and then there was lots of money, so really
Alice had nothing to complain of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lady Gale was still old-fashioned enough to mind a
little about mutual affection. Did they really care for each
other? Of course it was so difficult to tell about Tony because
he cared about everyone, and was perpetually enthusiastic
about the most absurdly ordinary people. His geese
were all swans, there was no question; but then, as he always
retorted, that was better than thinking that your swans,
when you did meet them, were all geese. Still, it did
make it difficult to tell. When, for instance, he rated a man
he had met in the hall of the hotel for the first time, and for
one minute precisely, on exactly the same scale as he rated
friends of a lifetime, what were you to think? Then Alice,
too, was difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was completely self-possessed and never at a loss, and
Lady Gale liked people who made mistakes. You always
knew exactly what Alice would say or think about any subject
under discussion. She had the absolutely sane and
level-headed point of view that is so annoying to persons of
impulsive judgment. Not that Lady Gale was impulsive;
but she was wise enough to know that some of the best people
were, and she distrusted old heads on young shoulders.
Miss Du Cane had read enough to comment sensibly and
with authority on the literature of the day. She let you
express your opinion and then agreed or differed with the
hinting of standards long ago formed and unflinchingly sustained,
and some laughing assertion of her own ignorance
that left you convinced of her wisdom. She always asserted
that she was shallow, and shallowness was therefore the last
fault of which she was ever accused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cared for Tony, there was no doubt of that; but then,
so did everybody. Lady Gale’s only doubt was lest she was
a little too matter-of-fact about it all; but, after all, girls
were very different nowadays, and the display of any emotion
was the unpardonable sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grouse! Hurray!” Tony displayed the menu. “The
first of the year. I’m jolly glad I didn’t go up with Menzies
to Scotland; it’s much better here, and I’m off shooting this
year——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s only because you always like the place you’re
in better than any other possible place, Tony,” said Alice.
“And I wish I had the virtue. Oh! those dreary months
with mother at Baden! They’re hanging over me still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I expect they gave your mother a great deal of
pleasure, my dear,” said Lady Gale, “and that after all is
something, even nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they didn’t, that’s the worst of it. She didn’t want
me a bit. There was old Lady Pomfret and Mrs. Rainer,
and oh! lots of others; bridge, morning, noon, and night, and
I used to wander about and mope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have been writing letters to Tony and me
all the time,” said Rupert, laughing. “You’ll never get
such a chance again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I did, didn’t I, Tony? Speak up for me, there’s
a brick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know,” said Tony. “They were jolly
short, and there didn’t seem to be much moping about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was to cheer you up. You didn’t want me to make
you think that I was depressed, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard had finished his grouse and could turn his
attention to other things. He complained of the brilliancy
of the lights, and some of them were turned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your man, Tony?” said Rupert. “Let’s see
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over there by the window—a man and a woman at a
table by themselves—a big man, clean shaven. There, you
can see him now, behind that long waiter—a pretty woman
in white, laughing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well! He’s better than some,” Rupert grudgingly
admitted. “Not so bad—strong, muscular, silent hero type—it’s
a pretty woman.” He fastened his eye-glass, an attention
that he always paid to anyone who really deserved it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I like him,” said Lady Gale; “what did you say
his name was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t quite catch it; Marabin, or Mara—no, I don’t
know—Mara—something. But I say, what are we going to
do to-night? We must do something. I was never so excited
in my life, and I don’t a bit know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that will pass,” said Rupert; “we know your moods,
Tony. You must take him out into the garden, Alice, and
quiet him down. Oh! look, they’re going, those Marabins
or whatever their names are. She carries herself well, that
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner always lasted a long time, because Sir Richard
enjoyed his food and had got a theory about biting each
mouthful to which he entirely attributed his healthy old
age; it entailed lengthy meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were almost the last people in the room when at
length they rose to go, and it was growing late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so sensible of them not to pull blinds down,” said
Tony, “the moon helps digestion.” Sir Richard, as was his
custom, went slowly and majestically up to his room, the
others into the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take Alice to see the view from the terraces, Rupert,”
said Lady Gale. “Tony and I will walk about here a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her arm through her son’s, and they passed up
and down the walks in front of the hotel. The vision of the
town in the distance was black, the gardens were cold and
white under the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! it is beautiful.” Lady Gale drew a deep breath.
“And when I’m in a place like this, and it’s England, I’m
perpetually wondering why so many people hurry away
abroad somewhere as soon as they’ve a minute to spare.
Why, there’s nothing as lovely as this anywhere!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony laughed. “There’s magic in it,” he said. “I
hadn’t set foot in the place for quarter of an hour before I
knew that it was quite different from all the other places I’d
ever been in. I wasn’t joking just now at dinner. I meant
it quite seriously. I feel as if I were just in for some enormous
adventure—as if something important were most certainly
going to happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something important’s always happening, especially at
your time of life; which reminds me, Tony dear, that I want
to talk to you seriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up in her face. “What’s up, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing’s up, and perhaps you will think me a silly
interfering old woman; but you know mothers are queer
things, Tony, and you can’t say that I’ve bothered you very
much in days past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” He suddenly put his arm round her neck, pulled
her head towards his and kissed her. “It’s all right.
There’s nobody here to see, and it wouldn’t matter a bit if
there were. No, you’re the very sweetest and best mother
that mortal man ever had, and you’re cursed with an ungrateful,
undutiful scapegrace of a son, more’s the pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she said, shaking her head, “that’s just what I
mean. Your mother is a beautiful and delightful joke like
everything and everybody else. It’s time, Tony, that you
were developing. You’re twenty-four, and you seem to me
to be exactly where you were at eighteen. Now I don’t
want to hurry or worry you, but the perpetual joke won’t do
any longer. It isn’t that I myself want you to be anything
different, because I don’t. I only want you to be happy;
but life’s hard, and I don’t think you can meet it by playing
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said nothing, but he gave her arm a little squeeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you know,” she went on, “you have absolutely no
sense of proportion. Everybody and everything are on exactly
the same scale. You don’t seem to me to have any
standard by which you estimate things. Everybody is nice
and delightful. I don’t believe you ever disliked anybody,
and it has always been a wonder to all of us that you haven’t
lost more from suffering so many fools gladly. I always
used to think that as soon as you fell in love with somebody—really
and properly fell in love with some nice girl—that
that seriousness would come, and so I didn’t mind. I don’t
want to hurry you in that direction, dear, but I would like
to see you settled. Really, Tony, you know, you haven’t
changed at all, you’re exactly the same; so much the same
that I’ve wondered a little once or twice whether you really
care for anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old mother, and my flightiness has worried you,
has it? I am most awfully sorry. But God made the fools
as well as the wits, and He didn’t ask the fools which lot they
wanted to belong to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but, Tony, you aren’t a fool, that’s just it. You’ve
got the brain of the family somewhere, only you seem to be
ashamed of it and afraid that people should know you’d got
it, and your mother would rather they did know. And then,
dear, there is such a thing as family pride. It isn’t snobbery,
although it looks like it; it only means, don’t be too
indiscriminate. Don’t have just anybody for a friend. It
doesn’t matter about their birth, but it does matter about
their opinions and surroundings. Some of them have been—well,
scarcely clean, dear. I’m sure that Mr. Templar
wasn’t a nice man, although I dare say he was very clever;
and that man to-night, for instance: I dare say he’s an excellent
man in every way, but you owe it to the family to
find out just a little about him first; you can’t tell just in a
minute——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped her for a minute and looked up at her quite
seriously. “I’ll be difficult to change, mother, I’m afraid.
How you and father ever produced such a vagabond I don’t
know, but vagabond I am, and vagabond I’ll remain in spite
of Oxford and the Bond Street tailor. But never you grieve,
mother dear, I’ll promise to tell you everything—don’t you
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But what about settling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, settling!” he answered gravely. “Vagabonds
oughtn’t to marry at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re happy about everything? You’re satisfied
with things as they are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course!” he cried. “Just think what kind of a
beast I’d be if I wasn’t. Of course, it’s splendid. And
now, mother, the jaw’s over and I’m the very best of sons,
and it’s a glorious night, and we’ll be as happy as the day
is long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They knelt on the seat at the south end and looked down
into the crooked streets; the moon had found its way there
now, and they could almost read the names on the shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Lady Gale put her hand against his cheek.
“Tony, dear, I care for you more than anything in the
world. You know it. And, Tony, always do what you feel
is the straight thing and I shall know it is right for you,
and I shall trust you; but, Tony, don’t marry anybody
unless you are quite certain that it is the only person. Don’t
let anything else influence you. Marriage with the wrong
person is——” Her voice shook for a moment. “Promise
me, Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise,” he answered solemnly, and she took his arm
and they walked back down the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert and Alice were waiting for them and they all went
in together. Lady Gale and Rupert said good night. Rupert
was always tired very early in the evening unless there
was bridge or a dance, but Alice and Tony sat in the sitting-room
by the open window watching the moonlight on the
sea and listening to the muffled thunder of the waves. Far
out into the darkness flashed the Porth Allen Lighthouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a little while they were silent, then Tony suddenly
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, am I awfully young?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up. “Young?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The mater has been talking to me to-night. She
says that it is time that I grew up, that I haven’t grown a bit
since I was eighteen, and that it must be very annoying for
everybody. Have you felt it, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I know what she means. It’s absurd,
but I always feel years older than you, although by age
I’m younger. But oh! it’s difficult to explain; one always
wants to rag with you. I’m always at my silliest when
you’re there, and I <span class='it'>hate</span> being at my silliest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you do, that’s your worst fault. But really, this
is rather dreadful. I must proceed to grow up. But tell me
honestly, am I a fool?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course you’re not, you’re awfully clever. But
that’s what we all think about you—you could do so many
things and you’re not doing anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat on the window-sill, swinging his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was once,” he began, “the King of Fools, and he
had a most splendid and widely attended Court; and one
day the Wisest Man in Christendom came to see and be
seen, and he talked all the wisest things that he had ever
learnt, and the fools listened with all their ears and thought
that they had never heard such folly, and after a time they
shouted derisively, not knowing that he was the Wisest Man,
‘Why, he is the biggest fool of them all!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The moral being?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold, the Wisest Man!” cried Tony, pointing dramatically
at his breast. “There, my dear Alice, you have the
matter in a nutshell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks for the compliment,” said Alice, laughing, “only
it is scarcely convincing. Seriously, Tony, Lady Gale is
right. Don’t be one of the rotters like young Seins or Rocky
Culler or Dick Staines, who spend their whole day in walking
Bond Street and letting their heads wag. Not, of course,
that you’d ever be that sort, but it would be rather decent
if you did something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can shoot a gun, I can ride a horse, I can serve corkers
from the back line at tennis, and score thirty at moderate
cricket; I can read French, German, Italian. I can play
bridge—well, fairly—I can speak the truth, eat meringues
all day with no evil consequences, stick to a pal, and walk
for ever and ever, Amen. Oh, but you make me vain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “None of those things are enough,” she
said. “You know quite well what I mean. You must take
a profession; why not Parliament, the Bar, writing?—you
could write beautifully if you wanted to. Oh, Tony!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have one,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now! What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The finest profession in the world—Odysseus, Jason,
Cœur-de-Lion, St. Francis of Assisi, Wilhelm Meister,
Lavengro. By the beard of Ahasuerus I am a wanderer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck an attitude and laughed, but there was a light
in his eyes and his cheeks were flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! what rot! There’s nobody so boring as somebody
on his hobby. I’m sorry, Alice, but you led me on; it’s your
own fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” she said, “that is the first time, Tony,
that I’ve ever heard you speak seriously about anything, and
really you don’t do it half badly. But, at the same time, are
you quite sure that you’re right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now? What I mean
is that things have changed so. I’ve heard people talk like
that before, but it has generally meant that they were unemployed
or something and ended up by asking for sixpence.
It seems to me that there’s such a lot to be done now, and
such a little time to do it in, that we haven’t time to go
round looking for adventure; it isn’t quite right that we
should if we’re able-bodied and can work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how serious we are all of a sudden,” he cried.
“One would think you ran a girls club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do go down to Southwark a lot,” she answered. “And
we’re badly in need of subscriptions. I’d meant to ask you
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s the unemployed now?” he said, laughing. “I
thought it would end in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must go to bed,” she said, getting up from the
window-sill. “It’s late and cold, and I’m sure we’ve had a
most inspiring talk on both sides. Good night, old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ta-ta,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after she had gone he sat by the window, thinking.
Was it true that he was a bit of a loafer? Had he really
been taking things too easily? Until these last two days he
had never considered himself or his position at all. He had
always been radiantly happy; self-questioning had been morbid
and unnecessary. It was all very well for pessimists
and people who wrote to the <span class='it'>Times</span>, but, with Pope, he
hummed, “Whatever is, is best,” and thought no more
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this place seemed to have changed all that. What
was there about the place, he wondered? He had felt curiously
excited from the first moment of his coming there, but
he could give no reason for it. It was a sleepy little place,
pretty and charming, of course, but that was all. But he had
known no rest or peace; something must be going to happen.
And then, too, there was Alice. He knew perfectly well why
she had been asked to join them, and he knew that she knew.
Before they had come down he had liked the idea. She
was one of the best and true as steel. He had almost decided,
after all, it was time that they settled down. And
then, on coming here, everything had been different. Alice,
his father, his mother, Rupert had changed; something was
wrong. He did not, could not worry it out, only it was terribly
hot, it was a beautiful night outside, and he wouldn’t
be able to sleep for hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed quietly down the stairs and out into the garden.
He walked down to the south end. It was most wonderful—the
moon, the stars, the whirling light at sea, and, quite
plainly, the noise of the fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leant over the wall and looked down. He was suddenly
conscious that some one else was there; a big man, in
evening dress, smoking a cigar. Something about him, the
enormous arms or the close-cropped hair, was familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Maradick. He looked up, and Tony at once wished
that he hadn’t said anything. It was the face of a man who
had been deep in his own thoughts and had been brought
back with a shock, but he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening. It’s wonderfully beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Gale,” said Tony apologetically, “I’m sorry if I interrupted
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no,” Maradick answered. “One can think at any
time, and I wanted company. I suppose the rest of the hotel
is in bed—rather a crime on a night like this.” Then he
suddenly held up a warning finger. “Listen!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite distinctly, and high above the noise of the fair, came
the voice of a man singing in the streets below. He sang
two verses, and then it died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a tune I heard last year,” Maradick said apologetically.
“I liked it and had connected it with this place.
I——” Then suddenly they heard it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both silent and listened together.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch04'>CHAPTER IV</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>IN WHICH THE AFORESAID ADMONITUS LEADS THE AFORESAID</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>MEMBERS OF SOCIETY A DANCE</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men stood there silently for some minutes; the
voice died away and the noise of the fair was softer and
less discordant; past them fluttered two white moths, the
whirr of their wings, the heavy, clumsy blundering against
Tony’s coat, and then again the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard it last year, that song,” Maradick repeated; he
puffed at his cigar, and it gleamed for a moment as some
great red star flung into the sky a rival to the myriads above
and around it. “It’s funny how things like that stick in
your brain—they are more important in a way than the bigger
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they are the bigger things,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell into silence again. He did not really want to talk,
and he wondered why this young fellow was so persistent.
He was never a talking man at any time, and to-night at any
rate he would prefer to be left alone. But after all, the
young fellow couldn’t know that, and he had offered to go.
He could not think connectedly about anything; he could only
remember that he had been rude to his wife at dinner. No
gentleman would have said the things that he had said. He
did not remember what he had said, but it had been very
rude; it was as though he had struck his wife in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he said, “it’s time chaps of your age were in bed.
Don’t believe in staying up late.” He spoke gruffly, and
looked over the wall on to the whirling lights of the merry-go-round
in the market-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said, you know,” said Tony, “that you wanted company;
but, of course——” He moved from the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! stay if you like. Young chaps never will go to bed.
If they only knew what they were laying in store for themselves
they’d be a bit more careful. When you get to be an
old buffer as I am——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old!” Tony laughed. “Why, you’re not old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t I? Turned forty, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’re one of the strongest-looking men I’ve ever
seen.” Tony’s voice was a note of intense admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick laughed grimly. “It isn’t your physical
strength that counts, it’s the point of view—the way you
look at things and the way people look at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desire to talk grew with him; he didn’t want to
think, he couldn’t sleep—why not talk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But forty anyhow,” said Tony, “isn’t old. Nobody
thinks you’re old at forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t they? Wait till you are, you’ll know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Balzac——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, damn your books! what do they know about it?
Everyone takes things from books nowadays instead of getting
it first hand. People stick themselves indoors and read
a novel or two and think they know life—such rot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony laughed. “I say,” he said, “you don’t think like
that always, I know—it’s only just for an argument.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick suddenly twisted round and faced Tony. He
put his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, kid,” he said, “go to bed. It doesn’t do a chap
of your age any good to talk to a pessimistic old buffer like
myself. I’ll only growl and you won’t be the better for it.
Go to bed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony looked up at him without moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll stay. I expect you’ve got the pip, and it
always does a chap good, if he’s got the pip, to talk to somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been here before?” asked Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes! last year. I shan’t come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It unsettles you. It doesn’t do to be unsettled when
you get to my time of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean—unsettles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick considered. How exactly did he mean—unsettles?
There was no doubt that it did, though.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not much good at explaining, but when you’ve
lived a certain time you’ve got into a sort of groove—bound
to, I suppose. I’ve got my work, just like another man.
Every morning breakfast the same time, same rush to the
station, same train, same morning paper, same office, same
office-boy, same people; back in the evening, same people
again, same little dinner, same little nap—oh, it’s like anyone
else. One gets into the way of thinking that that’s life,
bounded by the Epsom golf course and the office in town.
All the rest one has put aside, and after a time one thinks
that it isn’t there. And then a man comes down here and, I
don’t know what it is, the place or having nothing to do
upsets you and things are all different.” Then, after a moment,
“I suppose that’s what a holiday’s meant for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been trying to put his feelings into words, but
he knew that he had not said at all what he had really felt.
It was not the change of life, the lazy hours and the pleasant
people; besides, as far as that went, he might at any moment,
if he pleased, change things permanently. He had made
enough, he need not go back to the City at all; but he knew
it was not that. It was something that he had felt in the
train, then in the sight of the town, some vague discontent
leading to that outbreak at dinner. He was not a reading
man or he might have considered the Admonitus Locorum.
He had never read of it nor had he knowledge of such a spirit;
but it <span class='it'>was</span>, it must be, the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Tony, “of course I’ve never settled down to
anything, yet, you know; and so I can’t quite see as you
do about the monotony. My people have been very decent;
I’ve been able to wander about and do as I liked, and last
year I was in Germany and had a splendid time. Simply
had a <span class='it'>rucksack</span> and walked. And I can’t imagine settling
down anywhere; and even if I had somewhere—Epsom or
anywhere—there would be the same looking for adventure,
looking out for things, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adventures in Epsom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? I expect it’s full of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s because you’re young! I was like that once,
peering round and calling five o’clock tea a romance. I’ve
learnt better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned round. “It’s so absurd of you, you know,
to talk as if you were eighty. You speak as if everything
was over, and you’re only beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick laughed. “Well, that’s pretty good cheek from
a fellow half your age! Why, what do you know about life,
I’d like to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not much. As a matter of fact, it’s rather funny
your talking like that, because my people have been talking
to me to-night about that very thing—settling down, I mean.
They say that my roving has lasted long enough, and that I
shall soon be turning into a waster if I don’t do something.
Also that it’s about time that I began to grow up. I don’t
know,” he added apologetically, “why I’m telling you this,
it can’t interest you, but they want me to do just the thing
that you’ve been complaining about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, I haven’t been complaining,” said Maradick
hastily. “All I’m saying is, if you do get settled down
don’t go anywhere or do anything that will unsettle you again.
It’s so damned hard getting back. But what’s the use of
my giving you advice and talking, you young chaps never
listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sound as if they were enjoying themselves down
there,” said Tony a little wistfully. The excitement was still
in his blood and a wild idea flew into his brain. Why not?
But no, it was absurd, he had only known the man quarter of
an hour. The lights of the merry-go-round tossed like a thing
possessed; whirl and flash, then motionless, and silence again.
The murmured hum of voices came to their ears. After all,
why not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” Tony touched Maradick’s arm, “why shouldn’t
we stroll down there, down to the town? It might be amusing.
It would be a splendid night for a walk, and it’s only
twenty to eleven. We’d be back by twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down there? Now!” Maradick laughed. But he had
a strange yearning for company. He couldn’t go back into
the hotel, not yet, and he would only lose himself in his own
thoughts that led him nowhere if he stayed here alone. A
few days ago he would have mocked at the idea of wandering
down with a boy he didn’t know to see a round-about and some
drunken villagers; but things were different, some new impulse
was at work within him. Besides, he rather liked the
boy. It was a long while since anyone had claimed his companionship
like that; indeed a few days ago he would have
repelled anyone who attempted it with no uncertain hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick considered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, do!” said Tony, his hand still on Maradick’s
arm, and delighted to find that his proposal was being seriously
considered. “After all, it’s only a stroll, and we’ll
come back as soon as you wish. We can get coats from the
hotel; it might be rather amusing, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was feeling better already. It was, of course, absurd
that he should go out on a mad game like that at such an hour,
but—why not be absurd? He hadn’t done anything ridiculous
for fifteen years, nothing at all, so it was high time he
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>will</span> be a rag!” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went in to get their coats. Two dark conspirators,
they plunged down the little crooked path that was the quickest
way to the town. On every side of them pressed the smell
of the flowers, stronger and sweeter than in the daylight, and
their very vagueness of outline gave them mystery and charm.
The high peaks of the trees, outlined against the sky, assumed
strange and eerie shapes—the masts of a ship, the high pinnacle
of some cathedral, scythes and swords cutting the air;
and above them that wonderful night sky of the summer,
something that had in its light of the palest saffron promise
of an early dawn, a wonderful suggestion of myriad colours
seen dimly through the curtain of dark blue.</p>

<p class='line0'>“By night we lingered on the lawn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For underfoot the herb was dry;</p>

<p class='line0'>The silvery haze of summer drawn:</p>

<p class='line0'>And woolly breasts and beaded eyes:”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>quoted Tony. “Tennyson, and jolly good at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know it,” said Maradick rather gruffly. “Bad for
your business. Besides, what do those chaps know about life?
Shut themselves up in their rooms and made rhymes over
the fire. What could they know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, some of them,” said Tony, “knew a good bit. But
I’m sorry I quoted. It’s a shocking habit, and generally indulged
in to show superiority to your friends. But the sky
is just like that to-night. Drawn lightly across as though it
hid all sorts of things on the other side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick made no answer, and they walked on in silence.
They reached the end of the hotel garden, and passed through
the little white gate into a narrow path that skirted the town
wall and brought you abruptly out into the market-place by
the church. It passed along a high bank that towered over
the river Ess on its way to the sea. It was rather a proud
little river as little rivers go, babbling and chattering in its
early, higher reaches, with the young gaiety suited to country
vicarages and the paper ships of village children; and then,
solemn and tranquil, and even, perhaps, a little important,
as it neared the town and gave shelter to brown-sailed herring-boats,
and then, finally, agitated, excited, tumultuous as it
tumbled into its guardian, the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-night it passed contentedly under the walls of the town,
singing a very sleepy little song on its way, and playing games
with the moonlight and the stars. Here the noise of the fair
was hidden and everything was very still and peaceful. The
footsteps of the two men were loud and clear. The night air
had straightened Maradick’s brain and he was more at peace
with the world, but there was, nevertheless, a certain feeling
of uneasiness, natural and indeed inevitable in a man who,
after an ordered and regulated existence of many years, does
something that is unusual and a little ridiculous. He had
arrived, as was, indeed, the case with so many persons of
middle age, at that deliberate exclusion of three sides of life
in order to grasp fully the fourth side. By persistent practice
he had taught himself to believe that the other three sides
did not exist. He told himself that he was not adaptable,
that he had made his bed and must lie on it, that the moon
was for dreamers; and now suddenly, in the space of a day,
the blind was drawn from the window before which he had
sat for fifteen years, and behold! there were the stars!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tony began again. It had been said of him that his
worst fault was his readiness to respond, that he did not know
what it was to be on his guard, and he treated Maradick now
with a confidence and frankness that was curiously intimate
considering the length of their acquaintance. At length he
spoke of Alice Du Cane. “I know my people want it, and
she’s an awful good sort, really sporting, and the kind of girl
you’d trust to the end of your days. A girl you’d be absolutely
safe with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you care about her?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. We’ve known each other for years. We’re
not very sentimental about it, but then for my part I distrust
all that profoundly. It isn’t what you want nowadays; good
solid esteem is the only thing to build on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony spoke with an air of deep experience. Maradick,
with the thought of his own failure in his mind, wondered
whether, after all, that were not the right way of looking
at it. It had not been his way, fifteen years before; he
had been the true impetuous lover, and now he reaped his
harvest. Oh! these considering and careful young men and
girls of the new generation were learning their lesson, and
yet, in spite of it all, marriage turned out as many failures
as ever. But this remark of the boy’s had been little in agreement
with the rest of him; he had been romantic, impetuous,
and very, very young, and this serious and rather cynical
doctrine of “good solid esteem” was out of keeping with the
rest of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you mean that,” he said, looking sharply at
Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I’ve thought a great deal about marriage,
in our set especially. One sees fellows marrying every day,
either because they’re told to, or because they’re told not to,
and both ways are bad. Of course I’ve fancied I was in love
once or twice, but it’s always passed off. Supposing I’d married
one of those girls, what would have come of it? Disaster,
naturally. So now I’m wiser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you be too sure. It’s that wisdom that’s so dangerous.
The Fates, or whatever they are, always choose the
cocksure moment for upsetting the certainty. I shouldn’t
wonder if you change your views before you’re much older.
You’re not the sort of chap, if you’ll pardon my saying so,
to do those things so philosophically. And then, there’s something
in the air of this place——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony didn’t reply. He was wondering whether, after all,
he was quite so cocksure. He had been telling himself for
the last month that it was best, from every point of view, that
he should marry Miss Du Cane; his people, his future, his
certainty of the safety of it, all urged him, and yet—and
yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His mother’s words came back to him. “Tony,
don’t marry anybody unless you are quite certain that it is the
only person. Don’t let anything else influence you. Marriage
with the wrong person is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, in a moment, the fair was upon them. It had
just struck eleven and the excitement seemed at its height.
The market-place was very French in its neatness, and a certain
gathering together of all the life, spiritual and corporate,
of the town; the church, Norman, and of some historical interest,
filled the right side of the square. Close at its side,
and squeezed between its grey walls and the solemn dignity
of the Town Hall, was a tall rectangular tower crowded with
little slits of windows and curious iron bars that jutted out
into the air like pointing fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something rather pathetically dignified about
it; it protested against its modern neglect and desertion.
You felt that it had, in an earlier day, known brave times.
Now the ground floor was used by a fruiterer; apples and
plums, cherries and pears were bought and sold, and the
Count’s Tower was Harding’s shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were several other houses in the Square that told
the same tale, houses with fantastic bow-windows and little
pepper-pot doors, tiny balconies and quaintly carved figures
that stared at you from hidden corners; houses that were once
the height of fashion now hid themselves timidly from the
real magnificence of the Town Hall. Their day was over,
and perhaps their very life was threatened. The Town Hall,
with its dinners and its balls and its speeches, need fear no
rivalry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to-night the Town Hall was pushed aside and counted
for nothing at all. It was the one occasion of the year on
which it was of no importance, and the old, despised tower
was far more in keeping with the hour and the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the centre of the Square were rows of booths lighted
by gas-jets that flamed and flared in the night-air with the
hiss of many serpents. These filled the middle line of the
market. To the right was the round-about; its circle of lights
wheeling madly round and round gave it the vitality of a
living thing—some huge Leviathan on wheels bawling discordantly
the latest triumph of the Halls, and then, excited
by its voice, whirling ever swifter and swifter as though it
would hurl itself into the air and go rioting gaily through the
market, and then suddenly dropping, dead, exhausted, melancholy
at the ceasing of its song:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Put me amongst the—girls!</p>
<p class='line0'>Those wi-th the curly curls!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and then a sudden vision of dark figures leaping up and
down into the light and out of it again, the wild waving
of an arm, and the red, green and yellow of the horses as
they swirled up and down and round to the tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another corner, standing on a plank laid upon two
barrels, his arms raised fantastically above his head, was a
preacher. Around him was gathered a small circle of persons
with books, and faintly, through the noise of the merry-go-round
and the cries of those that bought and sold, came the
shrill, wavering scream of a hymn:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>So like little candles</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We shall shine,</p>
<p class='line0'>You in your small corner</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And I in mine.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Down the central alley passed crowds of men and women,
sailors and their sweethearts, for the most part; and strangely
foreign looking a great many of them were—brown and
swarthy, with black curling hair and dark, flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many country people wearing their Sunday
clothes with an uneasiness that had also something of admitted
virtue and pride about it. Their ill-fitting and absurdly
self-conscious garments hung about them and confined
their movements; they watched the scene around them almost
furtively, and with a certain subdued terror. It was the day,
the night of the year to them; it had been looked forward to
and counted and solemnised with the dignity of a much-be-thumbed
calendar, and through the long dreary days of
winter, when snow and the blinding mist hemmed in solitary
farms with desolation, it had been anticipated and foreseen
with eager intensity. Now that it was here and was so soon
to stand, a lonely pillar in the utterly uneventful waste-land
of the year, they looked at it timorously, fearfully, and yet
with eager excitement. These lights, this noise, this crowd,
how wonderful to look back upon it all afterwards, and how
perilous it all was! They moved carefully through the line
of booths, wondering at the splendour and magnificence of
them, buying a little once or twice, and then repenting of
what they had done. Another hour and it would be over;
already they shuddered at the blackness of to-morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the townspeople, the fishermen and sailors from
Penzance, it was an old affair; something amusing and calculated
to improve materially matters financial and matters
amatory, but by no means a thing to wonder at. The last
night of the three days fair was, however, of real importance.
According to ancient superstition, a procession was formed by
all the citizens of the town, and this marched, headed by
flaming torches and an ancient drum, round the walls. This
had been done, so went the legend, ever since the days of the
Celts, when naked invaders had marched with wild cries and
derisive gestures round and round the town, concluding with
a general massacre and a laying low of the walls. The town
had soon sprung to life again, and the ceremony had become
an anniversary and the anniversary a fair. The last dying
screams of those ancient peoples were turned, now, into the
shrieking of a merry-go-round and the sale of toffy and the
chattering of many old women; and there were but few in the
place who remembered what those origins had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Excitement was in the air, and the Square seemed to grow
more crowded at every moment. The flaring of the gas flung
gigantic shadows on the walls, and the light was on the town
so that its sides shone as though with fire. The noise was
deafening—the screaming of the roundabout, the shouts of
the riders, the cries and laughter of the crowd made a confused
babel of sound, and in the distance could be heard the
beating of the drum. It was the hour of the final ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Maradick, “what the people in those
houses think of it. Sleep must be a difficulty under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think,” said Tony, laughing, “that they are
all out here. I expect that most of the town is here by this
time.” And, indeed, there was an enormous crowd. The
preacher was in danger of being pushed off his plank; the
people surged round dancing, singing, shouting, and his little
circle had been caught in the multitude and had been swallowed
up. Very few of the people seemed to be listening to
him; but he talked on, waving the book in his hand, standing
out sharply against the shining tower at his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Words came to them: “To-morrow it will be too late.
I tell you, my friends, that it is now and now only that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And the door was shut .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We cannot choose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the drum was in the Square. Standing on the steps
of the Town Hall, clothed in his official red, the Town Clerk,
a short, pompous man, saluted the fair. No words could
penetrate the confusion, but people began to gather round
him shouting and singing. The buying and selling entered
into the last frenzied five minutes before finally ceasing altogether.
Prices suddenly fell to nothing at all, and wise and
cautious spirits who had been waiting for this moment
throughout the day crowded round and swept up the most
wonderful bargains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preacher saw the crowd had no ears for him now,
and so, with a last little despairing shake of the arm, he closed
his book and jumped off his plank. The round-about gave
a last shriek of enthusiasm and then dropped exhausted, with
the happy sense that it had added to the gaiety of the nations and
had brought many coppers into the pockets of its master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd surged towards the little red beadle with the
drum, and Maradick and Tony surged with it. It was beyond
question a very lively crowd, and it threatened to be livelier
with every beat of the drum. The sound was intoxicating
beyond a doubt, and when you had already paid a visit to
the “Red Lion” and enjoyed a merry glass with your best
friend, of course you entered into the spirit of things more
heartily than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, too, this dance round the town was the moment
of the year. It was the one occasion on which no questions
were asked and no surprise ever shown. Decorum and propriety,
both excellent things, were for once flung aside; for
unless they were discarded the spirit of the dance was not
enjoyed. It was deeply symbolic; a glorious quarter of an
hour into which you might fling all the inaction of the year—disappointment,
revenge, jealousy, hate went, like soiled
and useless rags, into the seething pot, and were danced away
for ever. You expressed, too, all your joy and gratitude for
a delightful year and a most merry fair, and you drank in,
as it were wine, encouragement and hope for the year to come.
There had been bad seasons and disappointing friends, and
the sad knowledge that you weren’t as strong as you had once
been; but into the pot with it all! Dance it away into limbo!
and, on the back of that merry drum, sits a spirit that will
put new heart into you and will send your toes twinkling
down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, best of all, it was a Dance of Hearts. It was
the great moment at which certainty came to you, and, as
you followed that drum down the curving street, you knew
that the most wonderful thing in the world had come to you,
and that you would never be quite the same person again;
perhaps she had danced with you down the street, perhaps
she had watched you and listened to the drum and known
that there was no question any more. I do not know how
many marriages in Treliss that drum had been answerable
for, but it knew its business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd began to form into some kind of order with a
great deal of pushing and laughter and noise. There were
whistles and little flags and tin horns. It was considered
to bring good luck in the succeeding year, and so every kind
of person was struggling for a place. If you had not danced
then your prospects for the next twelve months were poor
indeed, and your neighbours marked you down as some one
doomed to misfortune. Very old women were there, their
skirts gathered tightly about them, their mouths firm set
and their eyes on the drum. Old men were pushed aside by
younger ones and took it quietly and with submission, contenting
themselves with the thought of the years when they
had done their share of the fighting and had had a place with
the best. Towards the front most of the young men were
gathered. The crowd wound round the market, serpent-wise,
coiling round and over the booths and stalls, twisting past the
grey tower, and down finally into grey depths where the pepper-pot
houses bent and twisted under the red flare of the
lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick and Tony were wedged tightly between flank
and rear; as things were it was difficult enough to keep one’s
feet. At Maradick’s side was an old woman, stout, with her
bonnet whisked distractingly back from her forehead, her
grey hairs waving behind her, her hands pressed tightly over
a basket that she clasped to her waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh sirs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eh sirs!” pantingly, breathlessly she gasped
forth, and then her hand was hurriedly pressed to her forehead;
with that up flew the lid of the basket and the scraggy
lean neck of a hen poked miserably into the air and screeched
frantically. “Down, Janet; but the likes of this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never
did I see.” But nevertheless something triumphant in it all;
at least she kept her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already feet were beating to the tune of the drum; a
measured stamp, stamp on the cobbles spoke of an itching
to be off, a longing for the great moment. Waves of excitement
surged through the crowd. For a moment it seemed
as though everyone would be carried away, feet would lose
their hold of the pavement and the multitude would tumble
furiously down the hill; but no, the wave surged to the little
red drum and then surged back again. The drum was not
ready; everyone was not there. “Patience”—you could
hear it speak, stolidly, resolutely, in its beats—“Patience, the
time is coming if you will only be patient. You must trust
me for the great moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick was crushed against the old lady with the
basket; for an instant, a movement in the crowd flung him
forward and he caught at the basket to steady himself.
Really, it was too ridiculous! His hat had fallen to the back
of his head, he was hot and perspiring, and he wanted to
fling off his overcoat, but his hands were pressed to his sides.
Mechanically his feet were keeping time with the drum, and
suddenly he laughed. An old man in front of him was
crushed sideways between two stalwart youths, and every
now and again he struggled to escape, making pathetic little
movements with his hands and then sinking back again, resigned.
His old, wrinkled face, with a crooked nose and an
expression of timid anxiety, seemed to Maradick infinitely
diverting. “By Jove,” he cried, “look at that fellow!”
But Tony was excited beyond measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was crushed against Maradick, his cap balancing
ridiculously on the back of his head; his mouth was smiling
and his feet were beating time. “Isn’t it a rag? I say,
isn’t it? Such fun! Oh, I beg your pardon, I’m afraid
that I stepped on you. But there is a crowd, isn’t there?
It’s really awfully hard to help it. Oh! let me pick it up
for you—a cucumber, you said? Oh, there it is, rolled right
away under that man there.” “Oh thank you, if you
wouldn’t mind!” “No, it’s none the worse, missis. I say,
Maradick, aren’t they decent; the people, I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly they were off. The red coat of the
town-crier waved in the wind and the drum moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment a curious silence fell on the crowd. Before,
there had been Babel—a very ocean of voices mingled with
cries and horns and the blaring of penny whistles—you could
scarcely hear yourself speak. But now there was silence.
The drum beat came clearly through the air—one, two, one,
two—and then, with a shout the silence was broken and the
procession moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sudden linking of arms down the line and
Tony put his through Maradick’s. With feet in line they
passed down the square, bending forward, then back; at one
moment the old woman’s basket jumped suddenly into Maradick’s
stomach, then he was pushed from behind. He felt
that his cap was wobbling and he took it off, and, holding it
tightly to his chest, passed on bareheaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the turning of the corner the pace became faster.
The beat of the drum, heard faintly through the noise of the
crowd, was now “two, three, two, three.” “Come along,
come along, it’s time to move, I’m tired of standing still!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A delirium seemed to seize the front lines, and it passed
like a flame down the ranks. Faster, faster. For heaven’s
sake, faster! People were singing, a strange tune that
seemed to have no words but only a crescendo of sound, a
murmur that rose to a hum and then to a scream, and then
sank again back into the wind and the beat of the drum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left the market-place and were struggling, pressing,
down the narrow street that led to the bay. Some one
in front broke into a kind of dance-step. One, two, three,
then forward bending almost double, your head down, then
one, two, three, and your body back again, a leg in air, your
head flung behind. It was the dance, the dance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spirit was upon them, the drum had given the word,
and the whole company danced down the hill, over the cobbles.
One, two, three, bend, one, two, three, back, leg in air! “Oh,
but I can’t!” Maradick was panting. He could not stop,
for they were pressing close behind him. The old woman had
lost all sense of decorum. She waved her basket in the air,
and from its depths came the scream of the hen. Tony’s
arm was tight through his, and Tony was dancing. One,
two, three, and everyone bent together. One, two, three, legs
were in the air. Faces were flushed with excitement, hands
were clenched, and the tune rose and fell. For an instant
Maradick resisted. He must get out of it; he tried to draw
his arm away. It was held in a vice and Tony was too excited
to listen, and then propriety, years, tradition went
hustling to the winds and he was dancing as the others. He
shouted wildly, he waved his cap in the air; then he caught
the tune and shouted it with the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange hallucination came upon him that he was some
one else, that he, as Maradick, did not exist. Epsom was a
lie and the office in town a delusion. The years seemed to
step off his back, like Pilgrim’s pack, and so, shouting and
singing, he danced down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the bottom of the hill and turned the corner
along the path that led by the bay. The sea lay motionless
at their feet, the path of the moon stretching to the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tune was wilder and wilder; the dance had done its
work, and enough marriages were in the making to fill the
church for a year of Sundays. There was no surprise at the
presence of Tony and Maradick. This was an occasion in
which no one was responsible for their actions, and if gentlemen
chose to join, well, there was nothing very much to wonder
at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Tony it seemed the moment of his life. This was
what he had been born to do, to dance madly round the
town. It seemed to signify comradeship, good fellowship,
the true equality. It was the old Greek spirit come to life
again; that spirit of which he had spoken to Alice—something
that Homer had known and something that Whitman had
preached. And so up the hill! madly capering, gesticulating,
shouting. Some one is down, but no one stops. He is left
to pick himself up and come limping after. Mr. Trefusis
the butcher had been for a twelvemonth at war with Mr. Curtis
the stationer, now they are arm in arm, both absurdly
stout; the collar of Mr. Curtis is burst at the neck, but they
are friends once more. Mrs. Graham, laundress, had insulted
Miss Penny, dressmaker, four months ago, and they had not
spoken since; now, with bonnets awry and buttons bursting
down the back, it is a case of “Mary” and “Agnes” once
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! the drum knew its work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then it was suddenly over. The top of the hill completed
the circle and the market was reached again. The
drum beat a frantic tattoo on the steps of the Town Hall, the
crowd surged madly round the square, and then suddenly the
screams died away, a last feeble beat was heard, and there
was silence. People leaned breathlessly against any support
that might be there and thought suddenly of the disorder of
their dress. Everyone was perhaps a little sheepish, and
some had the air of those who had suddenly awaked from
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick came speedily to his senses. He did not know
what he had been doing, but it had all been very foolish.
He straightened his tie, put on his cap, wiped his forehead,
and drew his arm from Tony’s. He was very thankful that
there was no one there who knew him. What would his clerks
have said had they seen him? Fancy the office-boy! And
then the Epsom people. Just fancy! Louie, Mrs. Martin
Fraser, old Tom Craddock. Maradick, James Maradick
dancing wildly down the street with an old woman. It was
incredible!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was still that strange, half-conscious feeling that
it had not been Maradick at all, or, at any rate, some
strange, curious Maradick whose existence until to-night had
never been expected. It was not the Maradick of Epsom
and the City. And then the Admonitus Locorum, perched
gaily on his shoulder, laughed hilariously and winked at the
Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was excited as he had never been before, and was talking
eagerly to an old deaf man who had managed to keep up
with the company but was sadly exhausted by the doing of
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My last,” sighed the old man between gasps for breath.
“Don’t ’ee tell me, young feller, I shan’t see another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” Tony waved his arms in the air, “why, you’re
quite young still. You’re a fisherman, aren’t you? How
splendid. I’d give anything to be a fisherman. I’ll come
down and watch you sometimes and you must come up and
have tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Maradick intervened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, let’s get out of this, it’s so hot. Come away from
the crowd.” He pulled Tony by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.” Tony shook the old man by the hand.
“Good-bye, I’ll come and watch you fish one morning. By
Jove, it is hot! but what fun! Where shall we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I propose bed,” said Maradick, rather grimly. He felt
suddenly out of sympathy with the whole thing. It was as
though some outside power had slipped the real Maradick,
the Maradick of business and disillusioned forty, back into
his proper place again. The crowd became something common
and even disgusting. He glanced round to assure himself
that no one who mattered had been witness of his antics
as he called them; he felt a little annoyed with Tony for leading
him into it. It all arose, after all, from that first indiscreet
departure from the hotel. He now felt that an
immediate return to his rooms was the only secure method of
retreat. The dance stood before him as some horrible indiscretion
indulged in by some irresponsible and unauthorised
part of him. How could he! The ludicrous skinny neck of
the shrieking hen pointed the moral of the whole affair. He
felt that he had, most horribly, let himself down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, bed,” he said. “We’ve fooled enough.” But for
Tony the evening was by no means over. The dance had been
merely the symbol of a new order of things. It was the
physical expression of something that he had been feeling so
strangely, so beautifully, during these last few days. He
had called it by so many names—Sincerity, Simplicity,
Beauty, the Classical Spirit, the Heroic Age—but none of
these names had served, for it was made up of all these things,
and, nevertheless, was none of them alone. He had wondered
at this new impulse, almost, indeed, new knowledge; and yet
scarcely new, because he felt as if he had known it all, the
impulse and the vitality and the simplicity of it, some long
time before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now that dance had made things clearer for him. It
was something that he had done in other places, with other
persons, many hundreds, nay, thousands of years ago; he had
found his place in the golden chain that encircled the world.
And so, of course, he did not wish to go back. He would
never go back; he would never go to sleep again, and so he told
Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shall go,” said Maradick, and he led the way out
of the crowd. Then Tony felt that he had been rude. After
all, he had persuaded Maradick to come, and it was rather
discourteous now to allow him to return alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” he said regretfully, “it would be better. But
it is such a splendid night, and one doesn’t get the chance of
a game like that very often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Maradick, “perhaps it’s as well. I don’t know
what led me; and now I’m hot, dusty, beastly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say a drink,” said Tony. They had passed out of the
market-place and were turning up the corner of the crooked
street to their right. A little inn, the “Red Guard,” still
showed light in its windows. The door flung open and two
men came out, and, with them, the noise of other voices.
Late though the hour was, trade was still being driven; it was
the night of the year and all rules might be broken with impunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick and Tony entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doorway was low and the passage through which they
passed thick with smoke and heavy with the smell of beer.
The floor was rough and uneven, and the hissing gas, mistily
hanging in obscure distance, was utterly insufficient. They
groped their way, and at last, guided by voices, found the
door of the taproom. This was very full indeed, and the air
might have been cut with a knife. Somewhere in the smoky
haze there was a song that gained, now and again, at chorus
point, a ready assistance from the room at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was delighted. “Why, it’s Shelley’s Inn!” he cried.
“Oh! you know! where he had the bacon,” and he quoted:
“‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A Windsor chair, at a small round beechen table in a
little dark room with a well-sanded floor.’ It’s just as though
I’d been here before. What ripping chaps!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a small table in a corner by the door, and they
sat down and called for beer. The smoke was so thick that
it was almost as though they had the room to themselves.
Heads and boots and long sinewy arms appeared through the
clouds and vanished again. Every now and again the opening
of the door would send the smoke in whirling eddies down
the room and the horizon would clear; then, in a moment,
there was mist again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘What would Miss Warne say?’” quoted Tony. “You
know, it’s what Elizabeth Westbrook was always saying, the
sister of Harriet; but poets bore you, don’t they? Only it’s
a Shelley night somehow. He would have danced like anything.
Isn’t this beer splendid? We must come here
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick was ill at ease. His great overwhelming
desire was to get back, speedily, secretly, securely. He hated
this smelly, smoky tavern. He had never been to such a place
in his life, and he didn’t know why he had ever suffered Tony
to lead him there. He was rather annoyed with Tony, to
tell the truth. His perpetual enthusiasm was a trifle wearisome
and he had advanced in his acquaintanceship with a
rapidity that Maradick’s caution somewhat resented. And
then there was a lack of scale that was a little humiliating.
Maradick had started that evening with the air of one who
confers a favour; now he felt that he was flung, in Tony’s
brain, into the same basket with the old fisherman, the landlord
of the “Red Guard,” and the other jovial fellows in the
room. They were all “delightful,” “charming,” “the best
company”; there was, he felt resentfully, no discrimination.
The whole evening had been, perhaps, a mistake, and for the
future he would be more careful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly he noticed that some one was sitting
at their little table. It was strange that he had not seen
him before, for the table was small and they were near the
door. But he had been absorbed in his thoughts and his eyes
had been turned away. A little man in brown sat at his side,
quite silently, his eyes fixed on the window; he did not seem
to have noticed their presence. His age might have been
anything between forty and fifty, but he had a prosperous air
as of one who had found life a pleasant affair and anything
but a problem; a gentleman, Maradick concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he suddenly looked up and caught Maradick’s
gaze. He smiled. It was the most charming smile that
Maradick had ever seen, something that lightened not only
the face but the whole room, and something incredibly young
and engaging. Tony caught the infection of it and smiled
too. Maradick had no idea at the time that this meeting
was, in any way, to be of importance to him; but he remembered
afterwards every detail of it, and especially that beautiful
sudden smile, the youth and frankness in it. In other
days, when the moment had assumed an almost tragic importance
in the light of after events, the picture was, perhaps,
the most prominent background that he possessed; the misted,
entangled light struck the little dark black table, the sanded
floor, the highraftered ceiling: then there were the dark spaces
beyond peopled with mysterious shapes and tumultuous with
a hundred voices. And finally the quiet little man in
brown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been watching the festival?” he said. There
was something a little foreign in the poise and balance of
the sentence; the English pronunciation was perfect? but the
words were a little too distinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked at him again. There <span class='it'>was</span>, perhaps, something
foreign about his face—rather sallow, and his hair was
of a raven blackness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick. “It was most interesting. I
have never seen anything quite like it before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You followed it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Maradick hesitated a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” Tony broke in; “we danced as well. I never
had such fun. We’re up at the hotel there; we saw the lights
and were tempted to come down, but we never expected anything
like that. I wish there was another night of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was leaning back in his chair, his greatcoat flung open
and his cap tilted at the back of his head. The stranger
looked at him with appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you liked it. It’s <span class='it'>the</span> night for our little town,
but it’s been kept more or less to ourselves. People don’t
know about it, which is a good thing. You needn’t tell them
or it will be ruined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our town.” Then the man belonged to the place. And
yet he was surely not indigenous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not new to you?” said Maradick tentatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“New! Oh! dear me, no!” the man laughed. “I belong
here and have for many years past. At least it has
been my background, as it were. You would be surprised
at the amount that the place contains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, one can see that,” said Tony. “It has atmosphere
more than any place I ever knew—medieval, and not ashamed
of it, which is unusual for England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been almost untouched,” said the other, “by
all this modernising that is ruining England. We are exactly
as we were five hundred years ago, in spite of the hotel.
For the rest, Cornwall is being ruined. Look at Pendragon,
Conister, and hundreds of places. But here we have our
fair and our dance and our crooked houses, and are not
ashamed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick had no desire to continue the conversation.
He suddenly realised that he was very tired, sleepy—bed was
the place, and this place with its chorus of sailors and
smoke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He finished his beer and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid that we must be getting back,” he said. “It’s
very late. I had no intention really of remaining as late.”
He suddenly felt foolish, as though the other two were laughing
at him. He felt strangely irritated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he said to Tony, “it’s only myself. Don’t
you hurry; but old bones, you know——” He tried to carry
it off with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I’m coming,” said Tony. “We said we’d be back
by twelve, and we’ve got five minutes. So we’ll say good
night, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his hand to the man in brown. The stranger
took out a card-case and handed his card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In case you would care to see round the place—there’s
a good deal that I could show you. I should be very pleased
at any time if you are making a lengthy stay; I shall be here
for some months now, and am entirely at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Maradick as he spoke and smiled, but it was
obviously Tony for whom the invitation was meant. Maradick
felt absurdly out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you,” said Tony, “I should be awfully glad.
I think that we shall be here some time; I will certainly come
if I may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They smiled at each other, the stranger bowed, and they
were once more in the cooler air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the light of the lamp Tony read the card:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Andreas Morelli</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'><span class='it'>19 Trevenna Street, Treliss</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! a foreigner, as I thought,” said Tony. “What an
awfully nice man. Did you ever see such a smile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather a short acquaintance!” said Maradick. “We
only spoke to him for a minute, and then he offered his card.
One has to be a little careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you could tell he was all right,” said Tony; “look
at his eyes. But what fun it’s all been. Aren’t you glad
you came down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick couldn’t honestly say that he was, but he answered
in the affirmative. “Only, you know,” he said, laughing,
“it’s an unusual evening for a man like myself. We
run along on wheels and prefer sticking to the rails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were climbing the hill. “Why, this is Trevenna
Street!” cried Tony, catching sight of the name on one of the
houses. “The man lives here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street was quaint and picturesque, and on some of the
walls there was ancient carving; heads leered at them from
over the doors and window-ledges. Then it struck twelve
from somewhere in the town, and immediately all the lights
went out; the street was in darkness, for, at the moment, the
clouds were over the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in the provinces,” said Tony, laughing. “We
ought to have link-boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly above their heads there was a light. A window
was flung up and some one was standing there with a candle.
It was a girl; in the candle-light she stood out brilliantly
against the black background. She leaned out of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, father?” she called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then some one spoke from inside the room. There was
a petulant “Oh bother! Miss Minns!” and then the window
closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick had scarcely noticed the affair. He was hurrying
up the hill, eager to reach the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tony stood where he was. “By Jove!” he cried.
“Did you see her eyes? Wonderful! Why, you never in
all your life——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Candle-light is deceptive,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was wonderful! Glorious! Just for a moment like
that out of the darkness! But this is indeed a city of miracles!”
He looked back; the house was in absolute darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t like Miss Minns,” he added, “I expect Miss
Minns is a beast; I, too, hate Miss Minns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, in the dark, mysterious hall they parted. “Oh!
for bed!” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what a night!” cried Tony. “By heaven! what a
night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Admonitus Locorum smiled, very knowingly, from
the head of the stairs.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch05'>CHAPTER V</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MARADICK MAKES A PROMISE AND MEETS AN</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>ITINERANT OPTIMIST</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was the cleverest in the world. There was
nothing in Europe of its kind, and that was because its
cleverness lay in the fact that you never thought it clever
at all. It could, most amazingly, disappear so utterly and
entirely that you never had any thoughts about it at all, and
merely accepted it without discussion as a perfect background.
And then, suddenly, on a morning or an evening, it
would leap out at you and catch you by the throat; and the
traveller wondered and was aghast at its most splendid adaptability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, indeed, all things to all men; but it nevertheless
managed to bring out the best parts of them. All those
strange people that it had seen—painters and musicians,
the aristocracy and old maids, millionaires and the tumbled
wastrels cast out from a thousand cities—it gathered them
all, and they left it, even though they had passed but a night
in its company, altered a little. And it achieved this by its
adaptability. In its rooms and passages, its gardens and
sudden corners, its grey lights and green lawns, there was
that same secret waiting for an immediate revelation. Some
thought the house a tyranny, and others called it a surprise,
and a few felt that it was an impossibility, but no one disregarded
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Maradick, in these strange new days into which he was
entering, its charm lay in its age. That first view with the
dark, widening staircase that passed into hidden lights and
mysteries overhead and turned so nobly towards you the rich
gleam of its dark brown oak, the hall with its wide fireplace
and passages that shone, as all true passages should, like little
cups of light and shadow, grey and blue and gold, before
vanishing into darkness—this first glimpse had delighted
him; it was a hall that was a perfect test of the arriving
visitor, and Maradick had felt that he himself had been
scarcely quite the right thing. It was almost as though he
ought to have apologised for the colourless money-making
existence that had hitherto been his; he had felt this vaguely
and had been a little uncomfortable. But there were things
higher up that were better still. There were rooms that had,
most wisely, been untouched, and their dark, mysterious panelling,
the wistful scent of dried flowers and the wax of dying
candles; the suggestion—so that he held his breath sometimes
to listen whether it were really so—of rustling brocades and
the tiny click of shining heels on the polished floor, was of a
quite unequalled magic for him. Of course there was imagination
in it, and in the last few days these things had
grown and extended their influence over him, but there must
have been something there before, he argued, to impress so
matter-of-fact and solid a gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one room that drew him with especial force, so
that sometimes, before going to bed, he would enter with his
candle raised high above his head, and watch the shadow
on the floor and the high gloom of the carved ceiling. It contained
a little minstrels gallery supported on massive pillars
of gleaming oak, and round the bottom of the platform were
carved the heads of grinning lions, reminding one of that
famous Cremona violin of Herr Prespil’s. In the centre of
the room was an old table with a green baize cloth, and against
the wall, stiffly ranged and dusty from disuse, high-backed
quaintly carved chairs, but for the rest no carpet and no
pictures on the dark, thick walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was sometimes used for dancing, and at times for a
meeting or a sale of work; or perchance, if there were gentlemen
musically inclined, for chamber music. But it was
empty during half the year, and no one disturbed its dust; it
reminded Maradick of that tower in the market-place. They
were, both of them, melancholy survivals, but he applauded
their bravery in surviving at all, and he had almost a personal
feeling for them in that he would have liked them to know
that there was, at least, one onlooker who appreciated their
being there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were rooms and passages in the upper part of the
house that were equally delightful and equally solitary. He
himself had in his former year at Treliss thought them melancholy
and dusty; there had been no charm. But now the
room of the minstrels had drawn him frequently to its doors,
partly by reason of its power of suggestion—the valuation,
for him, of light and sound and colour, in their true and most
permanent qualities—partly by the amazing view that its
deep-set windows provided. It hung forward, as it were,
over the hill, so that the intervening space of garden and
tower and wood was lost and there was only the sea. It
seemed to creep to the very foot of the walls, and the horizon
of it was so distant that it swept into infinite space, meeting
the sky without break or any division. The height of the
room gave the view colour, so that there were deeper blues
and greens in the sea, and in the sky the greys and whites
were shot with other colours that the mists of the intervening
air had given them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these last few days Maradick had watched the view with
ever-increasing wonder. The sea had been to him before
something that existed for the convenience of human beings—a
means of transit, a pleasant place to bathe, sands for the
children, and the pier for an amusing walk. Now he felt
that these things were an impertinence. It seemed to him
that the sea permitted them against its will, and would, one
day, burst its restraint and pour in overwhelming fury on to
that crowd of nurses and nigger-minstrels and parasols; he
almost hoped that it would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loneliness was, however, largely responsible for this change
of view. There had been no one this time at the hotel to
whom he had exactly taken. There had been men last year
whom he had liked, excellent fellows. They had come there
for the golf and he had seen a good deal of them. There
might be some of the same kind now, but for some reason,
unanalysed and very mistily grasped, he did not feel drawn
towards them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Saturday of the end of that week was a terribly hot
day, and after lunch he had gone to his room, pulled down
his blinds, and slumbered over a novel. The novel was by
a man called Lester; he had made his name several years
before with “The Seven Travellers,” a work that had succeeded
in pleasing both critics and public. It was now in
its tenth edition. Maradick had been bored by “The Seven
Travellers”; it had seemed effete and indefinite. They
were, he had thought, always travelling and never getting
there, and he had put it down unfinished. The man knew
nothing of life at first hand, and the characters were too
obviously concerned in their own emotions to arouse any very
acute ones in the reader. But this one, “To Paradise,” was
better. If the afternoon had not been so very hot it might
even have kept him awake. The characters were still effete
and indefinite, motives were still crudely handled and things
were vague and obscure, but there was something in its very
formlessness that was singularly pleasing. And it was beautiful,
there was no doubt about that; little descriptions of
places and people that were charming not only for themselves
but also for the suggestions that they raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he woke it was nearly four o’clock. He remembered
that he had promised his wife to come down to tea.
She had met the Gales the day before and they were coming
to tea, and he had to be useful. There were a good many
little drawing-rooms in the hotel, so that you could ask more
people to tea than your own room would conveniently hold,
and nevertheless be, to all intents and purposes, private.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He yawned, stretched his arms above his head, and left his
room. Then he remembered that he had left a book in the
room with the minstrels gallery that morning. He went
upstairs to fetch it. The room itself lay in shadow, but outside,
beyond the uncurtained windows, the light was so fierce
that it hurt his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never seen anything to approach the colour. Sea
and sky were a burning blue, and they were seen through a
golden mist that seemed to move like some fluttering, mysterious
curtain between earth and heaven. There was perfect
stillness. Three little fishing-boats with brown sails, through
which the sun glowed with the red light of a ruby, stood out
against the staring, dazzling white of the distant cliffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found his book, and stood there for a moment wondering
why he liked the place so much. He had never been a
man of any imagination, but now, vaguely, he filled the space
around him with figures. He could not analyse his thoughts
at all, but he knew that it all meant something to him now,
something that had not been there a week ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went down to tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drawing-room was lying in shadow; the light and heat
were shut out by heavy curtains. His wife was making tea,
and as he came in at the door he realised her daintiness and
charm very vividly. The shining silver and delicate china
suited her, and there were little touches of very light blue
about her white dress that were vague enough to seem accidental;
you wondered why they had happened to be so exactly
in precisely the right places. There were also there Lady
and Sir Richard Gale, Alice Du Cane, Mrs. Lawrence, and
in the background with a diminutive kitten, Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something to eat, Miss Du Cane? What, nothing,
really?” He sat down beside her and Tony. She interested
him, partly because she was so beautiful and partly because
she was perhaps going to marry Tony. She looked very cool
now; a little too cool, he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well? Do you like this place?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Oh yes! It’s lovely, of course. But I think it
would be better if one had a cottage here, quite quietly. Of
course the hotel’s beautiful and most awfully comfortable,
but it’s the kind of place where one oughtn’t to have to think
of more than the place; it’s worth it. All the other things—dressing
and thinking what you look like, and <span class='it'>table d’hôte</span>—they
all come in between somehow like a wall. One
doesn’t want anything but the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>That</span>, he suddenly discovered, was why he liked the little
room upstairs, because it was, so simply and clearly, the
place. He looked at her gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “that’s just what I’ve been feeling. I
missed it last year somehow. It didn’t seem fine in quite the
same way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw that she was not really interested. She
thought of him, of course, as a kind of middle-aged banker.
He expected that she would soon try to talk to him about
self and the <span class='it'>table d’hôte</span> and bridge. He was seriously
anxious to show her that there were other things that he cared
for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve changed a lot since the other day, Alice,” said
Tony suddenly. “You told me you didn’t like Treliss a
bit, and now you think it’s lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do really,” said Alice, laughing. “That was only a
mood. How could one help caring? All the same you know
I don’t think it’s altogether good for one, it’s too complete a
holiday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very strenuous, Miss Du Cane,” said Maradick.
“Why shouldn’t we have holidays? It helps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes,” said Alice. “But then you work. Here am
I doing nothing all the year round but enjoy myself; frankly,
I’m getting tired of it. I shall buy a typewriter or something.
Oh! if I were only a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Tony. He laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s always doing that, Maradick—pitching into me
because I don’t do anything; but that’s only because she
doesn’t know in the least what I’m really doing. She doesn’t
know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, Mr. Maradick,” she said, turning round to him,
“make him start something seriously. Take him into your
office. He can add, I expect, or be useful in some way.
He’s getting as old as Methuselah, and he’s never done a
day’s work in his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although she spoke lightly, he could see that she meant
it very seriously. He wondered what it was that she wanted
him to do, and also why people seemed to take it for granted
that he had influence over Tony; it was as if Fate were driving
him into a responsibility that he would much rather avoid.
But the difficulty of it all was that he was so much in the
dark. These people had not let him into things, and yet they
all of them demanded that he should do something. He
would have liked to have asked her to tell him frankly what
it was that she wanted him to do, and, indeed, why she had
appealed to him at all; but there was no opportunity then.
At any rate he felt that some of her indifference was gone;
she had let him see that there were difficulties somewhere, and
that at least was partial confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick interrupted: “Miss Du Cane, I wonder if
you would come and make a four at bridge. It’s too hot to
go out, and Sir Richard would like a game. It would be
most awfully good of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice moved over to the card-table. Sir Richard played
continually but never improved. He sat down now with the
air of one who condescended; he covered his mistakes with the
assurance that it was his partner who was playing abominably,
and he explained carefully and politely at the end of the
game the things that she ought to have done. Mrs. Maradick
and Mrs. Lawrence played with a seriousness and compressed
irritation that was worthy of a greater cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony had slipped out of the room, and Lady Gale crossed
over to Maradick by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How quickly,” she said, “we get to know each other in
a place like this. We have only been here a week and I am
going to be quite confidential already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confidential?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I hope you won’t mind. You mustn’t mind,
because it’s my way. It always has been. If one is going
to know people properly then I resent all the wasted time that
comes first. Besides, preliminaries aren’t necessary with
people as old as you and I. We ought to understand by this
time. Then we really can’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked into her face, and knew that here at least there
would be absolute honesty and an explanation of some kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Lady Gale,” he said, “but I’m afraid I
don’t understand. I’ve been in the dark and perhaps you’ll
explain. Before I came down here I’d been living to myself
almost entirely—a man of my age and occupations generally
does—and now suddenly I’m caught into other people’s
affairs, and it’s bewildering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s all very simple,” she answered. “Of course
it’s about Tony. Everyone’s interested in Tony. He’s just
at the interesting age, and he’s quite exciting enough to make
his people wonder what he’ll turn into. It’s the chrysalis
into the—well, that just depends. And then, of course, I
care a great deal more than the rest. Tony has been different
to me from the rest. I suppose every mother’s like that, but
I don’t think most of them have been such chums with their
sons as I’ve been with Tony. We were alone in the country
together for a long time and there was nobody else. And
then the time came that I had prepared for and knew that I
must face, the time when he had things that he didn’t tell
me. Every boy’s like that, but I trusted him enough not to
want to know, and he often told me just because I didn’t ask.
Then he cared for all the right things and always ran
straight; he never bent his brain to proving that black’s
white and indeed rather whiter than most whites are, as so
many people do. But just lately I’ve been a little anxious—we
have all been—all of us who’re watching him. He
ought to have settled down to something or some one by this
time and one doesn’t quite know why he hasn’t; and he hasn’t
been himself for the last six months. Things ought to have
come to a head here. I don’t know what he’s been up to this
week, but none of us have seen anything of him, and I can see
that his thoughts are elsewhere all the time. It isn’t in the
least that I doubt him or am unhappy, it is only that I would
like some one to be there to give him a hand if he wants one.
A woman wouldn’t do; it must be a man, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think I’m the person,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he likes you. He’s taken to you enormously.
That’s always been a difficulty, because he takes to people
so quickly and doesn’t seem to mind very much whom it is;
but you are exactly the right man, the man I have wanted
him to care for. You would help him, you could help him,
and I think you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t, please, think that I mean you to spy in
any way,” she continued. “I don’t want you to tell me
anything. I shall never ask you, and you need never say
anything to me about it. It is only that I shall know that
there is some one there if he gets into a mess and I shall
know that he’s all right.” She paused again, and then went
on gently—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t think it funny of me to speak to you like
this when I know you so slightly. At my age one judges
people quickly, and I don’t want to waste time. I’m asking
a good deal of you, perhaps; I don’t know, but I think
it would have happened in any case whether I had spoken
or no. And then you will gain something, you know. No
one can be with Tony—get to know him and be a friend of
his—without gaining. He’s a very magical person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked down on the ground. He knew quite
well that he would have done whatever Lady Gale had asked
him to do. She had seemed to him since he had first seen
her something very beautiful and even wonderful, and he
felt proud and grateful that she had trusted him like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very good of you, Lady Gale,” he said; “I will
certainly be a friend of Tony’s, if that is what you want me
to do. He is a delightful fellow, much too delightful, I am
afraid, to have anything much to do with a dull, middle-aged
duffer like myself. I must wake up and shake some
of the dust off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled. “Thank you; you don’t know how grateful
I am to you for taking an interest in him. I shall feel ever
so much safer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the door opened and Tony came in. He crossed
over to her and said eagerly, “Mother, the Lesters are here.
Came this afternoon. They’re coming up in a minute; isn’t
it splendid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am glad—not too loud, Tony, you’ll disturb the
bridge. How splendid they’re coming; Mildred said something
in town about possibly coming down in the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the author-fellow, you know,” said Tony, turning
round to Maradick. “You were reading ‘To Paradise’
yesterday; I saw you with it. His books are better than
himself. But she’s simply ripping; the best fun you ever
saw in your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Maradick should feel any interest in meeting a
novelist was a new experience. He had formerly considered
them, as a class, untidy both in morals and dress, and had
decidedly preferred City men. But he liked the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I was reading ‘To Paradise this afternoon,’
he said. “It’s very good. I don’t read novels much, and
it’s very seldom that I read a new one, but there was something
unusual——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the door opened and the Lesters came in. She
was not pretty exactly, but striking—even, perhaps, he
thought afterwards, exciting. He often tried on later days
to call back the first impression that he had had of her,
but he knew that it had not been indifference. In the shaded
half-lights of the room, the grey blue shadows that the curtains
flung on to the dark green carpet made her dress of
light yellow stand out vividly; it had the color of primroses
against the soft, uncertain outlines of the walls and hidden
corners. There was a large black hat that hid her face and
forehead, but beneath it there shone and sparkled two dark
eyes that flung the heightened colour of her cheeks into relief.
But the impression that he had was something most
brilliantly alive; not alive in quite Tony’s way—that was a
vitality as natural as the force of streams and torrents and
infinite seas; this had something of opposition in it, as
though some battle had created it. Her husband, a dark,
plain man, a little tired and perhaps a little indifferent,
was in the background. He did not seem to count at the
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mildred, how delightful!” Lady Gale went forward
to her. “Tony’s just told me. I had really no idea
that you were coming; of course with a car one can do anything
and get anywhere, but I thought it would have been
abroad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it ought to have been,” said Mrs. Lester. “Fred
couldn’t get on with the new book, and suddenly at breakfast,
in the way he does, you know, said that we must be
in Timbuctoo that evening. So we packed. Then we wondered
who it was that we wanted to see, and of course it was
you; and then we wondered where we wanted to go, and of
course it was Treliss, and then when we found that you and
Treliss were together of course the thing was done. So here
we are, and it’s horribly hot. I only looked in to see you
for a second because I’m going to have a bath immediately
and change my things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crossed for a moment to the card-table and spoke to
Sir Richard. “No, don’t get up, Sir Richard, I wouldn’t
stop the bridge for the world. Just a shake of the fingers
and I’m off. How are you? Fit? I’m as right as a trivet,
thanks. Hullo, Alice! I heard you were here! Splendid!
I’ll be down later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband had shaken hands with Lady Gale and
talked to her for a moment, then they were gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just like Mildred,” said Lady Gale, laughing.
“In for a moment and out again, never still. When she
and Tony are together things move, I can tell you. Well,
I must go up to my room, any amount of letters to write
before dinner. Good-bye, Mr. Maradick, for the moment.
Thank you for the chat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were left alone Tony said, “Come out. It’s
much cooler now. It will be ripping by the sea. You’ve
been in all the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick, “I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He realised, as he left the room, that he and his wife had
scarcely met since that first evening. There had always
been other people, at meals, outside, after dinner; he knew
that he had not been thinking of her very much, but he suddenly
wondered whether she had not been a little lonely.
These people had not accepted her in quite the same way
that they had accepted him, and that was rather surprising,
because at Epsom and in town it had always been the other
way about. He had been the one whom people had thought
a bore; everyone knew that she was delightful. Of course
the explanation was that Tony had, as it were, taken him
up. All these people were interested in Tony, and had,
therefore, included Maradick. He could help a little in
the interpretation or rather the development of Tony, and
therefore he was of some importance. For a moment there
was a feeling of irritation at the position, and then he remembered
that it was scarcely likely that anyone was going
to be interested in him for himself, and the next best thing
was to be liked because of Tony. But it must, of course,
be a puzzle to his wife. He had caught, once or twice, a
look, something that showed that she was wondering, and
that, too, was new; until now she had never thought about
him at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony chattered all the way down to the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lesters are ripping. We’ve known Milly Lester
ever since the beginning of time. She’s not much older
than me, you know, and we lived next door to each other in
Carrington Gardens. Our prams always went out and
round the Square together, and we used to say goo-goo to
each other. Then later on I used to make up stories for
her. She was always awfully keen on stories and I was
rather a nailer at them; then we used to fight, and I slapped
her face and she pinched me. Then we went to the panto
together, and used to dance with each other at Christmas parties.
I was never in love with her, you know: she was just
a jolly good sort whom I liked to be with. She’s always
up to a rag; <span class='it'>he</span> thinks it’s a little too often. He’s a solemn
sort of beggar and jolly serious, lives more in his books
than out of them, which doesn’t make for sociability. Rather
hard luck on her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was his attraction for her?” asked Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Tony; “she admired his books
awfully and made the mistake of thinking that the man
was like them. So he is, in a way; it’s as if you’d married
the books, you know, and there wasn’t anything else there
except the leather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for a little time, and then Tony said,
“On a day like this one’s afraid—‘Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes,’ you know—it’s all <span class='it'>too</span> beautiful and wonderful
and makes such a splendid background for the adventure
that we’re on the edge of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adventure?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; you haven’t forgotten the other night, have you?
I’ve been waiting for you to speak to me about it. And
then this afternoon I saw it was all right. My asking you
to come out was a kind of test, only I knew you’d say yes.
I knew that mother had been talking to you about it. About
me and whether you’d help me? Wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s between your mother and myself,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was, all the same. And you said yes. And
it’s ripping, it’s just what I so especially wanted. They’ve
all been wondering what I’m up to. Of course they could
see that something was up; and they’re simply longing to
know all about it, the others out of curiosity and mother
because she cares. It isn’t a bit curiosity with her, you
know, it’s only that she wants to know that I’m safe, and
now that she’s stuck you, whom she so obviously trusts, as
a kind of bodyguard over me she’ll be comfortable and won’t
worry any more. It’s simply splendid—that she won’t
worry and that you said yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and stood in the path, looking at Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, you know,” he went on, with that charming,
rather crooked little smile that he had, “I do most awfully
want you for a friend quite apart from its making mother
comfortable. You’re just the chap to carry it through; I’m
right about it’s being settled, aren’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect I’m a fool,” he said, “at my age to meddle in
things that don’t concern me, but anyhow, there’s my hand
on it. I like you. I want waking up a bit and turning
round, and you’ll do it. So it’s a bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands very solemnly and walked on silently
down the path. They struck off to the right instead of turning
to the left through the town. They crossed a stile, and
were soon threading a narrow, tumbling little path between
two walls of waving corn. In between the stems poppies
were hiding and overhead a lark was singing. For a moment
he came down towards them and his song filled their ears,
then he circled up and far above their heads until he hung,
a tiny speck, against a sky of marble blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might tell me.” said Maradick, “what the adventure
really is. I myself, you know, have quite the vaguest
idea, and as I’m so immediately concerned I think I ought
to know something about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? I told you the other night,” said Tony; “and
things really haven’t gone very much further. I haven’t
seen her again, nor has Punch, and he has been about the
beach such a lot that he’d have been sure to if she’d been
down there. But the next step has to be taken with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” said Maradick a little apprehensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To call on that man who gave us his card the other
night. He’s got a lot to do with her, I know, and it’s the
very best of luck that we should have met him as we did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must say I didn’t like him for some quite unexplained
reason. But why not go and call without me? He doesn’t
want to see me; it was you he gave the card to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you must come. I should be afraid to go alone.
Besides, he might show you things in Treliss that you’d like
to see, although I suppose you’ve explored it pretty well for
yourself by this time. But, by the way, wherever have you
been this week? I’ve never seen you about the place or
with people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Maradick. “I discovered rather a jolly room
up in the top of the house somewhere, a little, old, deserted
place with an old-fashioned gallery and a gorgeous view.
I grew rather fond of the place and have been there a good
deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must show it me. We ought to have struck the place
by now. Oh, there it is, to the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had arrived at the edge of the cliff, and were looking
for a path that would take them down to the beach. Below
them was a little beach shut in on three sides by cliff.
Its sand was very smooth and very golden, and the sea came
with the very tiniest ripple to the edge of it and passed
away again with a little sigh. Everything was perfectly
still. Then suddenly there was a bark of a dog and a
man appeared on the lower rocks, sharply outlined against
the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What luck!” cried Tony. “It’s Punch. I wanted you
to meet him, and he may have a message for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man saw them and stepped down from the rocks on
to the beach and came towards them, the dog after him.
A little crooked path brought them to him, and Maradick
was introduced. It was hard not to smile. The man was
small and square; his legs were very short, but his chest was
enormous, and his arms and shoulders looked as though they
ought to have belonged to a much bigger man. His mouth
and ears were very large, his nose and eyes small; he was
wearing a peaked velvet cap, a velveteen jacket and velveteen
knickerbockers. Maradick, thinking of him afterwards,
said of him that he “twinkled;” that was the first
impression of him. His legs, his eyes, his nose, his mouth
stretched in an enormous smile, had that “dancing” effect;
they said, “We are here now and we are jolly pleased to see
you, but oh! my word! we may be off at any minute, you
know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog, a white-haired mongrel, somewhat of the pug
order, was a little like its master; its face was curiously similar,
with a little nose and tiny eyes and an enormous mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me introduce you,” said Tony. “Punch, this is a
friend of mine, Mr. Maradick. Maradick, this is my friend
and counsellor, Punch; and, oh, yes, there’s Toby. Let me
introduce you, Toby. Mr. Maradick—Toby. Toby—Mr.
Maradick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man held out an enormous hand, the dog gravely
extended a paw. Maradick shook both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very pleased to meet you,” he said. “Tony has
told me about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, I’m sure,” the man answered; “I’m
very pleased to meet <span class='it'>you</span>, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause, and they sat down on the sand with
their backs against the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Punch,” said Tony, “how’s the show? I haven’t
seen you since Thursday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the <span class='it'>show’s</span> all right,” he answered. “There’s never
no fear about that. My public’s safe enough as long as
there’s children and babies, which, nature being what it is,
there’ll always be. It’s a mighty pleasant thing having a
public that’s always going on, and it ain’t as if there was
any chance of their tastes changing either. Puppies and
babies and kittens like the same things year in and year out,
bless their little hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a Punch and Judy show, haven’t you?” said
Maradick a little stiffly. He was disgusted at his stiffness,
but he felt awkward and shy. This wasn’t the kind of fellow
that he’d ever had anything to do with before; he could
have put his hand into his pocket and given him a shilling
and been pleasant enough about it, but this equality was
embarrassing. Tony obviously didn’t feel it like that, but
then Tony was young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; Punch and Judy shows are getting scarce,
what with yer cinematographs and pierrots and things. But
there’s always customers for ’em and always will be. And
it’s more than babies like ’em really. Many’s the time I’ve
seen old gentlemen and fine ladies stop and watch when they
think no one’s lookin’ at ’em, and the light comes into their
eyes and the colour into their cheeks, and then they think
that some one sees ’em and they creep away. It’s natural
to like Punch; it’s the banging, knock-me-down kind of
humour that’s the only genuine sort. And then the moral’s
tip-top. He’s always up again, Punch is, never knows when
he’s beat, and always smiling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick, but he knew that he would have
been one of those people who would have crept away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s another thing,” said the man; “the babies
know right away that it’s the thing they want. It’s my belief
that they’re told before they come here that there’s Punch
waiting for them, otherwise they’d never come at all. If
you gave ’em Punch right away there wouldn’t be any howling
at all; a Punch in every nursery, I say. You’d be surprised,
sir, to see the knowin’ looks the first time they see
Punch, you’d think they’d seen it all their lives. There’s
nothing new about it; some babies are quite <span class='it'>blasé</span> over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then there are the nursemaids,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Punch, “they’re an easy-goin’ class, nursemaids.
Give them a Punch and Judy or the military and
there’s nothing they wouldn’t do for you. I’ve a pretty
complete knowledge of nursemaids.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you travel about?” said Maradick; “or do
you stay more or less in one part of the country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay! Lord bless you, sir! I never stay anywhere;
I’m up and down all the time. It’s easy enough to travel.
The show packs up small, and then there’s just me and
Toby. Winter time I’m in London a good bit. Christmas
and a bit after. London loves Punch and always will.
You’d think that these music-halls and pantomimes would
knock it out, but not a bit of it. They’ve a real warm feeling
for it in London. And they aren’t the sort of crowd
who stand and watch it and laugh and smack their thighs,
and then when the cap comes round start slipping off and
pretendin’ they’ve business to get to, not a bit of it. They’d
be ashamed not to pay their little bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then in the summer?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Cumberland for a bit and then Yorkshire, and then
down here in Cornwall. All round, you know. There are
babies everywhere, and some are better than others. Now
the Cumberland babies beat all the rest. Give me a Cumberland
baby for a real laugh. They’re right enough down
here, but they’re a bit on their dignity and afraid of doing
the wrong thing. But I’ve got good and bad babies all over
the place. I reckon I know more about babies than anyone
in the land. And you see I always see them at their best—smiling
and crowing—which is good for a man’s ’ealth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was sinking towards the sea, and there was perfect
silence save for the very gentle ripple of the waves.
It was so still that a small and slightly ruffled sparrow
hopped down to the edge of the water and looked about it.
Toby saw him, but only lazily flapped an ear. The sparrow
watched the dog for a moment apprehensively, then decided
that there was no possible danger and resumed its contemplation
of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waves were so lazy that they could barely drag their
way up the sand. They clung to the tiny yellow grains as
though they would like to stay and never go back again;
then they fell back reluctantly with a little song about their
sorrow at having to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great peace was in Maradick’s heart. This was the
world at its most absolute best. When things were like this
there were no problems nor questions at all; Epsom was an
impossible myth and money-making game for fools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony broke the silence:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Punch, have you any message for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, not exactly a message, but I’ve found out something.
Not from the young lady herself, you understand.
She hasn’t been down again—not when I’ve been there.
But I’ve found out about her father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father?” said Tony excitedly; and Toby also sat
up at attention as though he were interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; he’s the little man in brown you spoke of. Well
known about here, it seems. They say he’s been here as
long as anyone can remember, and always the same. No
one knows him—keeps ’imself to ’imself; a bit lonely for
the girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man!” cried Tony. “And he’s asked me to call!
Why, it’s fate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grasped Maradick’s arm excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s her father! her father!” he cried. “And he’s
asked us to call! <span class='it'>Her</span> father, and we’re to call!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re to call!” corrected Maradick. “He never said
anything about me; he doesn’t want me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course you’re to come. ’Pon my word, Punch,
you’re a brick. Is there anything else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes,” said Punch slowly. “He came and spoke
to me yesterday after the show. Said he liked it and was
very pleasant. But I don’t like ’im all the same. I agree
with that gentleman; there’s something queer there, and
everyone says so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Tony. “Never mind about
the man. He’s her father, that’s the point. My word, what
luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Punch shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they say against him, then?” said Tony.
“What reasons have they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that’s just it,” said Punch; “they haven’t got no
reasons. The man ’asn’t a ’istory at all, which is always an
un’ealthy sign. Nobody knows where ’e comes from nor
what ’e’s doing ’ere. ’E isn’t Cornish, <span class='it'>that’s</span> certain. ’E’s
got sharp lips and pointed ears. I don’t like ’im and Toby
doesn’t either, and ’e’s a knowing dog if ever there was
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not to be daunted,” said Tony; “the thing’s
plainly arranged by Providence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick, looking at Punch, thought that he knew
more than he confessed to. There was silence again, and
they watched a gossamer mist, pearl-grey with the blue of
the sea and sky shining through, come stealing towards them.
The sky-line was red with the light of the sinking sun, and
a very faint rose colour touched with gold skimmed the crests
of tiny waves that a little breeze had wakened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ripples that ran up the beach broke into white foam
as they rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be getting on, Mr. Tony,” said Punch,
rising. “I am at Mother Shipton’s to-night. Good-bye,
sir,” he shook hands with Maradick, “I am pleased to ’ave
met you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony walked a little way down the beach with him, arm
in arm. They stopped, and Punch put his hand on the
boy’s shoulder and said something that Maradick did not
catch; but he was speaking very seriously. Then, with the
dog at his heels, he disappeared over the bend of the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better be getting along too,” said Tony. “Let’s
go back to the beach. There’ll be a glorious view!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems a nice fellow,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Punch! He’s simply ripping! He’s one of the
people whose simplicity seems so easy until you try it, and
then it’s the hardest thing in the world. I met him in town
last winter giving a show somewhere round Leicester Square
way, and he was pretty upset because Toby the dog was ill.
I don’t know what he’d do if that dog were to die. He
hasn’t got anyone else properly attached to him. Of course,
there are lots of people all over the country who are very fond
of him, and babies, simply any amount, and children and
dogs—anything young—but they don’t really belong to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick felt that, honestly, he wasn’t very attracted.
The man was a vagabond, after all, and would
be much better earning his living at some decent trade; a
strong, healthy man like that ought to be keeping a wife and
family and doing his country some service instead of wandering
about the land with a dog; it was picturesque, but
improper. But he didn’t say anything to Tony about his
opinions—also he knew that the man didn’t annoy him as
he would have done a week ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned the bend of the cliffs the tower suddenly
rose in front of them like a dark cloud. It stood out sharply,
rising to a peak biting into the pale blue sky, and vaguely
hinting at buildings and gabled roofs; before it the sand
stretched, pale gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony put his arm through Maradick’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they were not sure; it might be imagination. In
the misty and uncertain light figures seemed to rise out of
the pale yellow sands and to vanish into the dusky blue of
the sea. But at the same moment they realised that there
was some one there and that he was waiting for them; they
recognised the brown jacket, the cloth cap, the square, prosperous
figure. The really curious thing was that Maradick
had had his eyes fixed on the sand in front of him, but he
had seen no one coming. The figure had suddenly materialised,
as it were, out of the yellow evening dusk. It
was beyond doubt Mr. Andreas Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was the same as he had been a week ago. There was
no reason why he should have changed, but Maradick felt
as though he had been always, from the beginning, the same.
It was not strange that he had not changed since last week,
but it was strange that he had not changed, as Maradick
felt to be the case, since the very beginning of time; he had
always been like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He greeted Tony now with that beautiful smile that
Maradick had noticed before; it had in it something curiously
intimate, as though he were referring to things that
they both had known and perhaps done. Tony’s greeting
was eager and, as usual with him, enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli turned to Maradick and gravely shook hands.
“I am very pleased to see you again, sir,” he said. “It is
a most wonderful evening to be taking a stroll. It has been
a wonderful day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been too good to be true,” said Tony; “I don’t
think one ought ever to go indoors when the weather is like
this. Are you coming back to the town, Mr. Morelli, or were
you going farther along the beach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be very glad to turn back with you, if I may,”
he said. “I promised to be back by half-past seven and it
is nearly that now. You have never fulfilled your promise
of coming to see me,” he said reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tony, “to tell you the truth I was a little
shy; so many people are so kind and invite one to come,
but it is rather another thing, taking them at their word and
invading their houses, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can assure you I meant it,” said Morelli gravely.
“There are various things that would interest you. I have
quite a good collection of old armour and a good many odds
and ends picked up at different times.” Then he added,
“There’s no time like the present; why not come back and
have supper with us now? That is if you don’t mind taking
pot-luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony flushed with pleasure. “I think we should be delighted,
shouldn’t we, Maradick? They’re quite used to our
not coming back at the hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you very much,” said Maradick. “It’s certainly
good of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noticed that what Punch had said was true; the ears
were pointed and the lips sharp and thin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dusk had swept down on them. The lights of the
town rose in glittering lines one above the other in front of
them; it was early dusk for an August evening, but the dark
came quickly at Treliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sea was a trembling shadow lit now and again with
the white gleam of a crested wave. On the horizon there
still lingered the last pale rose of the setting sun and across
the sky trembling bars of faint gold were swiftly vanishing
before the oncoming stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli talked delightfully. He had been everywhere,
it appeared, and spoke intimately of little obscure places
in Germany and Italy that Tony had discovered in earlier
years. Maradick was silent; they seemed to have forgotten
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered the town and passed through the market-place.
Maradick looked for a moment at the old tower,
standing out black and desolate and very lonely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hotel the dusk would be creeping into the little
room of the minstrels. There would be no lights there, only
the dust and the old chairs and the green table; from the
open window you would see the last light of the setting sun,
and there would be a scent of flowers, roses and pinks, from
the garden below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had stopped outside the old dark house with the
curious carving. Morelli felt for the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what my daughter will have prepared,”
he said apologetically, “I gave her no warning.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch06'>CHAPTER VI</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>SUPPER WITH JANET MORELLI</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little hall was lit by a single lamp that glimmered
redly in the background. Small though the hall was,
its darkness gave it space and depth. It appeared to be
hung with many strange and curious objects—weapons of
various kinds, stuffed heads of wild animals, coloured silks
and cloths of foreign countries and peoples. The walls
themselves were of oak, and from this dark background
these things gleamed and shone and twisted under the red
light of the lamp in an alarming manner. An old grandfather
clock tick-tocked solemnly in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli led them up the stairs, with a pause every now
and again to point out things of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house is, you know,” he said almost apologetically,
“something of a museum. I have collected a good deal one
way and another. Everything has its story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick thought, as his host said this, that he must know
a great many stories, some of them perhaps scarcely creditable
ones. The things that he saw had in his eyes a sinister
effect. There could be nothing very pleasant about those
leering animals and rustling, whispering skins; it gave the
house, too, a stuffy, choked-up air, something a little too
full, and full, too, of not quite the pleasantest things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The staircase was charming. A broad window with diamond-shaped
panes faced them as they turned the stair and
gave a pleasant, cheerful light to the walls and roof. A silver
crescent moon with glittering stars attending it shone at
the window against an evening sky of the faintest blue; a
glow that belonged to the vanished sun, and was so intangible
that it had no definite form of colour, hung in the air and
passed through the window down the stairs into the dark
recesses of the hall. The walls were painted a dark red that
had something very cheerful and homely about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly from the landing above them came voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Miss Minns, I’m going to wait. I don’t care;
father said he’d be back. Oh! I hear him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A figure came to the head of the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, do hurry up; Miss Minns is so impatient at
having to wait, and I said I wouldn’t begin till you came,
and the potatoes are black, black, black.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked up and saw a girl standing at the head
of the stairs. In her hand she held a small silver lamp that
flung a pale circle of yellow behind and around her; she
held it a little above her head in order that she might see
who it was that mounted the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought she was the most beautiful girl that he had
ever seen; her face was that of a child, and there was still
in it a faint look of wonderment and surprise, as though she
had very recently broken from some other golden dream and
discovered, with a cry, the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mouth was small, and curved delicately like the petals
of a very young rose that turn and open at the first touch of
the sun’s glow. Her eyes were so blue that there seemed
no end at all to the depth, and one gazed into them as into
a well on a night of stars; there were signs and visions in
them of so many things that a man might gaze for a year
of days and still find secrets hidden there. Her hair was
dark gold and was piled high in a great crown, and not so
tightly that a few curls did not escape and toss about her
ears and over her eyes. She wore a gown of very pale blue
that fell in a single piece from her shoulders to her feet;
her arms to the elbow and her neck were bare, and her dress
was bound at the waist by a broad piece of old gold embroidered
cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her colouring was so perfect that it might have seemed
insipid were it not for the character in her mouth and eyes
and brow. She was smiling now, but in a moment her face
could change, the mouth would grow stiff, her eyes would
flash; there was character in every part of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was tall and very straight, and her head was poised
perfectly. There was dignity and pride there, but humour
and tenderness in the eyes and mouth; above all, she was
very, very young. That look of surprise, and a little perhaps
of one on her guard against a world that she did not
quite understand, showed that. There was no fear there,
but something a little wild and undisciplined, as though
she would fight to the very last for her perfect, unfettered
liberty: this was Janet Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had thought that her father was alone, but now she
realised that some one was with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stepped back and blushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon. I didn’t know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me introduce you,” said Morelli. “Janet, this is
Mr. Maradick and this Mr. Gale. They have come to have
supper with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put the lamp down on the little round table behind
her and shook hands with them. “How do you do?” she
said. “I hope you’re not in the least bit hungry, because
there’s nothing whatever to eat except black potatoes, and
they’re not nice at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was quite without embarrassment and smiled at Maradick.
She put her arm on her father’s shoulder for a moment
by way of greeting, and then they walked into the
room opposite the staircase. This was in strong contrast
to the hall, being wide and spacious, with but little furniture.
At one end was a bow-window with old-fashioned lozenge-shaped
panes; in this a table laid for three had been placed.
The walls were painted a very pale blue, and half-way up,
all the way round, ran a narrow oaken shelf on which were
ranged large blue and white plates of old china, whereon
there ran riot a fantastic multitude of mandarins, curiously
twisted castles, and trembling bridges spanning furious torrents.
There were no pictures, but an open blue-tiled fireplace,
the mantelpiece of which was of dark oak most curiously
carved. There were some chairs, two little round
tables, and a sofa piled high with blue cushions. There were
lamps on the tables, but they were dim and the curtains
were not drawn, so that through the misty panes the lights
of the town were twinkling in furious rivalry with the lights
of the dancing stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the table was waiting a little woman in a stiff black
dress. There was nothing whatever remarkable about her.
There was a little pretentiousness, a little pathos, a little
beauty even; it was the figure of some one who had been
left a very long time ago, and was at last growing accustomed
to the truth of it—there was no longer very much
hope or expectation of anything, but simply a kind of fairy-tale
wonder as to the possibility of the pumpkin’s being
after all a golden coach and the rats some most elegant coachmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Minns,” said Morelli, “let me introduce you.
These are two gentlemen who will have supper with us. Mr.
Maradick and Mr. Gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very pleased to meet you,” said Miss Minns a
little gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a servant of the name of Lucy, who laid two
more places clumsily and with some noise. Janet had disappeared
into the kitchen and Morelli maintained the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, however, a feeling of constraint. Maradick
had never known Tony so silent. He stood by the fireplace,
awkwardly shifting from one leg to the other, and
looking continually at the door. He was evidently in a
state of the greatest excitement, and he seemed to pay no
attention to anyone in the room. Miss Minns was perfectly
silent, and stood there gravely waiting. Morelli talked
courteously and intelligently, but Maradick felt that he himself
was being used merely as a background to the rest of
the play. His first feeling on seeing Janet had been that
Tony was indeed justified in all his enthusiasm; his second,
that he himself was in for rather a terrible time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not in the least expected her to be so amazingly
young. He had, quite without reason or justification, expected
her to be older, a great deal older, than Tony, and
that chiefly, perhaps, because he couldn’t, by any stretch of
imagination, believe her to be younger. Tony was so young
in every way—in his credibility, his enthusiasm, his impatience,
his quite startling simplicity. With this in front of
him, Maradick had looked to the lady as an accomplice; she
would help, he had thought, to teach Tony discretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, with that vision of her on the stairs, he saw
that she was, so to speak, “younger than ever,” as young
as anyone possibly could be. That seemed to give the whole
business a new turn altogether; it suddenly placed him,
James Maradick, a person of unimaginative and sober middle
age, in a romantic and difficult position of guardian to
a couple of babies, and, moreover, babies charged to the full
with excitement and love of hurried adventure. Why, he
thought desperately, as he listened politely to Morelli’s conversation,
had he been made the centre of all this business?
What did he or could he know of young people and their
love affairs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid,” he said politely, “I know nothing whatever
about swords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Morelli heartily, “I must show you some after
supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet entered with chops and potatoes, followed by Lucy
with the coffee. Tony went forward to help her. “No,
thank you,” she said, laughing. “You shan’t carry the potatoes
because then you’ll see how black they are. I hope
you don’t mind coffee at the beginning like this; and there’s
only brown bread.” She placed the things on the table and
helped the chops. Tony looked at his plate and was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, at first, a difficult meal, and everyone was very
subdued; then suddenly the ice was broken. Maradick had
said that he lived in London. Miss Minns sat up a little
straighter in her chair, smoothed her cuffs nervously, and
said with a good deal of excitement—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lived a year in London with my brother Charles. We
lived in Little Worsted Street, No. 95, near the Aquarium:
a little house with green blinds; perhaps, sir, you know it.
I believe it is still standing; I loved London. Charles was
a curate at St. Michael’s, the grey church at the corner of
Merritt Street; Mr. Roper was rector at the time. I remember
seeing our late beloved Queen pass in her carriage.
I have a distinct recollection of her black bonnet and gracious
bow. I was very much moved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick had, very fortunately, touched on the only topic
that could possibly be said to make Miss Minns loquacious.
Everyone became interested and animated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I should so love London!” Janet said, looking
through the window at the stars outside. “People! Processions!
Omnibuses! Father has told me about it sometimes—Dick
Whittington, you know, and the cat. I suppose
you’re not called Dick?” she said, looking anxiously at
Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Tony, “I’m afraid I’m not. But I will be
if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is scarcely polite, Janet,” said Morelli, “to ask a
gentleman his name when you’ve only known him five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t,” she answered. “Only I do want to know a
Dick so very badly, and there aren’t any down here; but I
expect London’s full of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s full of everything,” said Tony, “and that’s why I
like this place so awfully. London chokes you, there’s such
a lot going on; you have to stop, you know. Here you can
go full tilt. May I have another chop, please? They’re
most awfully good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was rapidly becoming his usual self. He was still
a little nervous, but he was talking nonsense as fluently as
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really must come up to London though, Miss Morelli.
There are pantomimes and circuses and policemen
and lots of funny things. And you can do just what you
like because there’s no one to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! theatres!” She clapped her hands. “I should
simply love a theatre. Father took me once here; it was
called ‘The Murdered Heir,’ and it was most frightfully
exciting; but that’s the only one I’ve ever seen, and I don’t
suppose there’ll be another here for ages. They have them
in Truro, but I’ve never been to Truro. I’m glad you like
the chops, I was afraid they were rather dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are,” said Morelli. “It’s only Mr. Gale’s politeness
that makes him say they’re all right. They’re dreadfully
dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you were late,” she answered; “it was your fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was excited. Her eyes were shining, her hands trembled
a little, and her cheeks were flushed. Maradick fancied
that there was surprise in her glance at her father. Miss
Minns also was a little astonished at something. It was
possibly unusual for Morelli to invite anyone into the house,
and they were wondering why he had done it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli was a great puzzle. He seemed changed since
they had sat down at the table. He seemed, for one thing,
considerably younger. Outside the house he had been middle-aged;
now the lines in his forehead seemed to disappear,
the wrinkles under his eyes were no longer there. He
laughed continually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, in fact, becoming very rapidly a merry meal.
The chops had vanished and there was cheese and fruit.
They were all rather excited, and a wave of what Maradick
was inclined to call “spirited childishness” swept over the
party. He himself and Miss Minns were most decidedly out
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was significant of the change that Morelli now paid
much more attention to Tony. The three of them burst into
roars of laughter about nothing; Tony imitated various animals,
the drawing of a cork, and a motor-omnibus running
into a policeman, with enormous success. Miss Minns made
no attempt to join in the merriment; but sat in the shadow
gravely silent. Maradick tried and was for a time a miserable
failure, but afterwards he too was influenced. Morelli
told a story that seemed to him extraordinarily funny. It
was about an old bachelor who always lived alone, and some
one climbed up a chimney and stuck there. He could not
afterwards remember the point of the story, but he knew
that it seemed delightfully amusing to him at the time. He
began to laugh and then lost all control of himself; he
laughed and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. He
stopped for a moment and then started again; he grew red
in the face and purple—he took out his handkerchief and
wiped his eyes. “Oh, dear!” he said, gasping, “that’s a
funny story. I don’t know when I’ve laughed like that before.
It’s awfully funny.” He still shook at the thought
of it. It was a very gay meal indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been at the University, I suppose, Mr. Gale?”
said Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Oxford,” said Tony. “But please don’t call me
Mr.; nobody calls me Mr., you know. You have to have a
house, a wife and a profession if you’re Mr. anybody, and I
haven’t got anything—nothing whatever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wonder,” said Janet, “if you’d mind opening
the door for me. We’ll clear the table and get it out of
the way. Saturday is Lucy’s night out, so I’m going to do
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let me help,” said Tony, jumping up and nearly
knocking the table over in his eagerness. “I’m awfully
good at washing things up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t have to wash anything up,” she answered.
“We’ll leave that for Lucy when she comes back; but if
you wouldn’t mind helping me to carry the plates and things
into the other room I’d be very grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked very charming, Maradick thought, as she stood
piling the plates on top of one another with most anxious
care lest they should break. Several curls had escaped and
were falling over her eyes and she raised her hand to push
them back; the plates nearly slipped. Maradick, watching
her, caught suddenly something that seemed very like terror
in her eyes; she was looking across the table at her father.
He followed her glance, but Morelli did not seem to have
noticed anything. Maradick forgot the incident at the time,
but afterwards he wondered whether it had been imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do be careful and not drop things,” she said, laughing
gaily, to Tony. “You seem to have got a great many there;
there’s plenty of time, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was delightful to watch, she was so entirely unconscious
of any pose or affectation. She passed into the
kitchen singing and Tony followed her laden with plates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you smoke, Mr. Maradick?” said Morelli. “Cigar?
Cigarette? Pipe?—Pipe! Good! much the best thing.
Come and sit over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew up their chairs by the window and watched the
stars; Miss Minns sat under the lamp sewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick was a little ashamed of his merriment at dinner;
he really didn’t know the man well enough, and a little
of his first impression of cautious dislike returned. But
Morelli was very entertaining and an excellent talker, and
Maradick reproached himself for being unnecessarily suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” said Morelli, “it’s a great thing to have a
home like this. I’ve been a wanderer all my days—been
everywhere, you might say—but now I’ve always got this
to come back to, and it’s a great thing to feel that it’s there.
I’m Italian, you know, on my father’s side, and hence my
name; and so it seems a bit funny, perhaps, settling down
here. But one country’s the same to me as another, and
my wife was English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused for a moment and looked out of the window;
then he went on—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t see many people here; when you’ve got a girl
to bring up you’ve got to be careful, and they don’t like me
here, that’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused again, as though he expected Maradick to deny
it. He had spoken it almost as an interrogation, as though
he wanted to know whether Maradick had heard anything,
but Maradick was silent. He felt strongly again, as he had
felt at the time of their first meeting, that they were hostile
to one another. Polite though Morelli was, Maradick knew
that it was because of Tony, and not in the least because of
himself. Morelli probably felt that he was an unnecessary
bore, and resented his being there. It was Tony that he
cared about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a very delightful boy,” Morelli said, nodding
in the direction of the kitchen. “Have you known him
a long while? Quite one of the most delightful people——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said Maradick a little stiffly. “We are quite
new acquaintances. We have only known each other about
a week. Yes, he is an enormously popular person. Everyone
seems to like him wherever he goes. He wakes people
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there’s wonderful vitality there. I hope he’ll keep
it. I hope that I shall see something of him while he is
here. There isn’t much that we can offer you, but you will
be doing both my daughter and myself a very real kindness
if you will come and see us sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I promised to show you those swords of mine.
Come and see them now. I think there are really some that
may interest you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got up and left the room. In a moment the door
was opened again and Janet and Tony returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s sit in front of the window,” Janet said, “and talk.
Father’s showing your friend his swords and things, I expect,
and he always takes an enormous time over that, and I
want to talk most frightfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat forward with her hands round her knees and her
eyes gazing out of the window at the stars. Tony will always
remember her like that; and as he sat and watched her
he had to grip the side of his chair to prevent his leaning
forward and touching her dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to talk too,” he answered; “it’s an ‘experience’
evening, you know, one of those times when you suddenly
want to exchange confidences with some one, find out what
they’ve been doing and thinking all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I know that feeling,” she answered eagerly, “but
I’ve never had anyone to exchange them with. Sometimes
I’ve felt it so that I haven’t known what to do; but it’s been
no good, there’s been nobody except father and Miss Minns.
It’s very funny, isn’t it? but you’re the first person of my
own age I’ve ever met. Of course you’re older really, but
you’re near enough, and I expect we think some of the same
things; and oh! it’s so exciting!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said “person” like a creature of fifty, and he smiled,
but then her “exciting” brought his heart to his mouth.
She was obviously so delighted to have him, she accepted
him so readily without any restrictions at all, and it was wonderful
to him. Every girl that he had ever met had played
a game either of defence or provocation, but there was perfect
simplicity here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s begin,” he said, “and find out whether we’ve had
the same things. But first I must tell you something. This
isn’t the only time that I’ve seen you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; there was the other day on the beach; you were
with your father. I looked at you from behind a rock and
then ran away. And the other time was one night about a
week ago, quite late, and you leaned out of a window and
said something to Miss Minns. There was a lamp, and I
saw your face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! which night?” she said quite eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me see, I think it was a Thursday night—no,
I can’t remember—but there was a fair in the town; they
danced round the streets. We had been, Maradick and I,
and were coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I remember perfectly,” she said, turning round and
looking at him. “But, do you know, that’s most curious!
I was tremendously excited that night, I don’t quite know
why. There was no real reason. But I kept saying to Miss
Minns that I knew something would happen, and she laughed
at me and said, ‘What could?’ or something, and then I
suddenly opened the window and two people were coming
up the street. It was quite dark. There was only the
lamp!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke quite dramatically, as though it was something
of great importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And fancy, it was you!” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, please,” she said, “let’s begin confidences. They’ll
be back, and we’ll have to stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! mine are ordinary enough,” he said, “just like anybody
else’s. I was born in the country; one of those old
rambling country houses with dark passages and little stairs
leading to nowhere, and thick walls with a wonderful old
garden. Such a garden, with terraces and enormous old
trees, and a fountain, and a sun-dial, and peacocks. But
I was quite a kid when we left that and came to town. It
is funny, though, the early years seem to remain with one
after the other things have gone. It has always been a background
for me, that high old house with the cooing of pigeons
on a hot summer’s afternoon, and the cold running of
some stream at the bottom of the lawn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how beautiful,” she said. “I have never known
anything like that. Father has talked of Italy; a little
town, Montiviero, where we once lived, and an old grey
tower, and a long, hard white road with trees like pillars.
I have often seen it in my dreams. But I myself have
never known anything but this. Father has stayed here,
partly, I think, because the old grey tower in the market-place
here is like the tower at Montiviero. But tell me about
London,” she went on. “What is it like? What people are
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“London,” he said, “has grown for me as I have grown
to know it. We have always lived in the same house. I
was six when I first went there, an old dark place with
large solemn rooms and high stone fireplaces. It was in
a square, and we used to be taken out on to the grass in
the morning to play with other children. London was at
first only the square—the dark rooms, my nurse, my father
and mother, some other children, and the grass that we
played upon. Then suddenly one day the streets sprang
upon me—the shops, the carriages, some soldiers. Then it
grew rapidly; there were the parks, the lake, the Tower,
and, most magical of all, the river. When I was quite a
small boy the river fascinated me, and I would escape there
when I could; and now, if I lived alone in London, I would
take some old dark rooms down in Chelsea and watch the
river all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chelsea!” she said. “I like the sound of that. Is
there a very wonderful river, then, where London is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered, “it is dirty and foggy, and the
buildings along the banks of it are sometimes old and in
pieces. But everyone that has known it will tell you the
same. Then I went to a pantomime with my nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I know what a pantomime is,” she said. “Miss
Minns once saw one, but there was a man with a red nose
and she didn’t like it. Only there were fairies as well, and
if I’d been there I should only have seen the fairies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this was ‘Dick Whittington.’ There was a glorious
cat. I don’t remember about the rest; but I went home
in a golden dream and for the next month I thought of nothing
else. London became for me a dark place with one
glorious circle of light in the midst of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! It must have been beautiful!” she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” he went on, “it spread from that, you know,
to other things, and I went to school. For a time everything
was swallowed up in that, beating other people, coming out
top, and getting licked for slacking. London was fun for
the holidays, but it wasn’t a bit the important thing. I was
like that until I was seventeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were very lucky,” Janet said, “to go to school. I
asked father once, but he was very angry; and, you know, he
is away for months and months sometimes, and then it is
most dreadfully lonely. I have never had anyone at all to
talk to until you came, and now they’ll take you away in a
moment, so do hurry up. There simply isn’t a minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Minns was heard to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you cold by the window, Janet? I think you’d
better come nearer the table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! please don’t interrupt, Miss Minns!” She waved
her hand. “It’s as warm as toast, really. Now please go
on, it’s a most terribly exciting adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, sinking his voice and speaking in a
dramatic whisper, “the next part of the tremendous adventure
was books and things. I suddenly, you know, discovered
what they were. I’d read things before, of course,
but it had always been to fill in time while I was waiting
for something else, and now I suddenly saw them differently,
in rows and rows and rows, each with a secret in it
like a nut, and I cracked them and ate them and had the
greatest fun. Then I began to think that I was awfully
clever and that I would write great books myself, and I was
very solemn and serious. I expect I was simply hateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did you write anything?” she said in an awed
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered solemnly, “a very long story with
heaps of people and lots of chapters. I have it at home.
They liked it down in the kitchen, but it never had an end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” Janet asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, like the Old Woman in the Shoe, I had so
many children that I didn’t know what to do. I had so
many people that I simply didn’t know what to do with them
all. And then I grew out of that. I went to Oxford, and
then came the last part of the adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Oxford?” she asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! It’s a university. Men go there after leaving
school. It’s a place where a man learns a good many useless
habits and one or two beautiful ones. Only the beautiful
ones want looking for. The thing I found was walking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her and laughed for the very joy of being
so near to her. In the half light that the lamp flung upon
them the gold of her hair was caught and fell like a cloud
about her face, the light blue of her dress was the night
sky, and her eyes were the stars. Oh! it was a fine adventure,
this love! There had been no key to the world before
this came, and now the casket was opened and stuffs of
great price, jewels and the gold-embroidered cloths of God’s
workshop were spread before him. And then a great awe
fell upon him. She was so young and so pure that he felt
suddenly that all the coarse thoughts and deeds of the world
rose in a dark mist between them, and sent him, as the
angel with the flaming sword sent Adam, out of so white a
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she suddenly leant over and touched his arm. “Oh!
do look at Miss Minns!” she said. Miss Minns was falling
asleep and struggling valiantly against the temptation. Her
hands mechanically clicked the needles and clutched the piece
of cloth at which she was working, but her head nodded violently
at the table as though it was telling a story and furiously
emphasising facts. The shadow on the wall was gigantic,
a huge fantastic Miss Minns swinging from side to
side on the ceiling and swelling and subsiding like a curtain
in the wind. The struggle lasted for a very short time.
Soon the clicking of the needles ceased, there was a furious
attempt to hold the cloth, and at last it fell with a soft noise
to the ground. Miss Minns, with her head on her breast,
slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better,” said Janet, settling herself back in her
chair. “Now about the walking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! you’re fond of it too,” he said. “I can see that.
And it’s the only thing, you know. It’s the only thing that
doesn’t change and grow monotonous. You get close right
down to earth. They talk about their nature and culture
and the rest, but they haven’t known what life is until they’ve
felt the back of a high brown hill and the breast of a hard
white road. That saved me! I was muddled before. I
didn’t know what things stood for, and I was unhappy. My
own set weren’t any use at all, they were aiming at nothing.
Not that I felt superior, but it was simply that that sort of
thing wasn’t any good for me. You couldn’t see things
clearly for the dust that everybody made. So I left the dust
and now I’m here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s all?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely all,” he answered. “I’m afraid it’s disappointing
in incident, but it is at any rate truthful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but it’s adventurous,” she said, “beside mine.
There’s nothing for me to tell at all. I’ve simply lived here
with father always. There have been no books, no children,
nothing at all except father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused then in rather a curious way. He looked
up at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! father’s so different—you never know. Sometimes
he’s just as I am, plays and sings and tells stories. And
then, oh! he’s such fun. There never was anybody like him.
And sometimes he’s very quiet and won’t say anything, and
then he always goes away, perhaps it’s only a day or two, and
then it’s a week or a month even. And sometimes,” she
paused again for a moment, “he’s angry, terribly angry, so
that I am awfully frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! with you?” Tony asked indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; with no one exactly, but it’s dreadful. I go and
hide.” And then she burst out laughing. “Oh, and once
he caught Miss Minns like that, and he pulled her hair and
it fell all over her shoulders. Oh! it was so funny. And a
lot of it came out altogether; it was false, you know. I think
that father is just like a child. He’s ever so much younger
than I am really. I’m getting dreadfully old, and he’s as
young as can be. He tells stories—beautiful stories! and
then he’s cross and he sulks, and sometimes he’s out of doors
for days together, and all the animals simply love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these facts she brought out, as it were, in a bunch,
without any very evident connexion, but he felt that the cord
that bound them was there and that he could find it one
day. But what surprised him most was her curious aloofness
from it all, as if he were a friend, perhaps a chum,
sometimes a bother and sometimes a danger, but never a
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But tell me about yourself,” he said, “what you like
and what you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there’s really nothing. I’ve just lived here always,
that’s all. You’re the first man I’ve talked to, except father,
and you’re fun. I hope that we shall see you sometimes
whilst you are staying here,” she added, quite frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody told you to say that,” he said, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s Miss Minns. She teaches me sometimes about
what you ought to say, and I’m dreadfully stupid. There
are so many of them. There’s ‘at a wedding’ and ‘at a
funeral’ and there’s ‘the dinner party,’ a nice one and a
dull one and a funny one, and there’s ‘at the theatre,’ and
lots more. Sometimes I remember, but I’ve never had anyone
to practise them on. You’re quite the first, so I think I
ought to give you them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened and Maradick and Morelli came in. The
pair at the window did not see them and the two men stood
for a moment at the door. Morelli smiled, and Maradick
at once felt again that curious unfounded sensation of distrust.
The man amazed him. He had talked about his
“things,” his armour, some tapestry, some pictures, with a
knowledge and enthusiasm that made him fascinating. He
seemed to have the widest possible grip on every subject;
there was nothing that he did not know. And there had
been, too, a lightness of touch, a humorous philosophy of
men and things for which he had been quite unprepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then again, there would be suddenly that strange
distrust; a swift glance from under his eyelids, a suspicious
lifting of the voice, as though he were on his guard against
some expected discovery. And then, most puzzling of all,
there was suddenly a simplicity, a <span class='it'>naïveté</span>, that belonged to
childhood, some anger or pleasure that only a child could
feel. Oh! he was a puzzle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of those two in the window he felt suddenly
a sharp, poignant regret! What an old fool he was to
meddle with something that he had passed long, long before.
You could not be adaptable at forty, and he would only spoil
their game. A death’s head at the feast indeed, with his
own happy home to think of, his own testimony to fling before
them. But the regret was there all the same; regret that he
had not known for ever so many years, and a feeling of loneliness
that was something altogether new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew now that, during these last few days, Tony had
filled his picture, some one that would take him out of himself
and make him a little less selfish and even, perhaps, a
little younger; but now, what did Tony—Tony in love, Tony
with a new heaven and a new earth—want with a stout
cynic of forty! It would have been better, after all, if they
had never met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Miss Minns awoke, and was extremely upset.
Some half-remembered story of gentlemen winning a pair
of gloves under some such circumstances flew to her mind;
at any rate it was undignified with two new persons in the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really——” she said. “You were quite a long time.
I have been sewing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of her voice Tony turned back from the
window. He was so happy that he would have clasped Miss
Minns round the neck and kissed her, if there had been any
provocation. The lamp flung a half-circle of light, leaving
the corners in perfect darkness, so that the room was curved
like a shell; the shining tiles of the fireplace sparkled under
the leaping flame of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been a very long time,” said Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s scarcely a compliment to Mr. Gale,” said Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I haven’t found it so,” she answered quickly.
“It has been enormously interesting. We have been discovering
things. And now, father, play. Mr. Gale loves
music, I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Morelli played was a little surprising. There was
no piano in the room, and Maradick wondered what the instrument
would be. They all sat down in a circle round
the fireplace, and behind them, in the dusk of the room,
Morelli produced a flute from his pocket. He had said nothing,
and they were all of them suddenly silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident seemed to Maradick a key—a key to the
house, to the man, and, above all, to the situation. This
was not a feeling that he could in the least understand. It
was only afterwards that he saw that his instinct had been
a right one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the idea that he had of their all being children together—Tony,
Janet, Morelli—was exactly represented by
the flute. There was something absolutely irresponsible in
the gay little tune piped mysteriously in the darkness, a
little tune that had nothing in it at all except a pressing
invitation to dance, and Maradick could see Tony’s feet going
on the floor. It would not be at all impossible, he felt,
for them suddenly to form a ring and dance riotously round
the room; it was in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a person of very slight imagination, but the tune
gave him the long hillside, the white sails of the flying clouds,
the shrill whistle of wind through a tossing forest of pines,
white breakers against a black cliff, anything open and unfettered;
and again he came back to that same word—irresponsible.
The little tune was repeated again and again,
with other little tunes that crept shyly into it for a moment
and then out and away. The spell increased as the tune continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Tony it was magical beyond all words. Nothing
could have put so wonderful a seal on that wonderful evening
as that music. His pulse was beating furiously and his
cheeks were burning; he wanted now to fling himself on
his knees, there on the floor, and say to her, “I love you!
I love you!” like any foolish hero in a play. He moved
his chair ever so slightly so that it should be nearer hers,
and then suddenly, amazed at his daring, his heart stopped
beating; she must have noticed. But she gazed in front of
her, her hands folded in her lap, her eyes gravely bent towards
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this melancholy little tune, coming mysteriously from
some unknown distance, seemed to give him permission to
do what he would. “Yes, love,” it commanded. “Do what
is natural. Come out on to the plain where all freedom is
and there are winds and the clear sky and everything that is
young and alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could almost fancy that Morelli himself was giving him
permission, but at a thought so wild he pulled himself up.
Of course Morelli didn’t know; he was going too fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick began to be vaguely irritated and at last annoyed.
There was something unpleasant in that monotonous
little tune coming out of the darkness from nowhere at all;
its note of freedom seemed to become rapidly something lawless
and undisciplined. Had he put it into pictures, he
would have said that the open plain that he had seen before
became suddenly darkened, and, through the gloom, strange
animals passed and wild, savage faces menaced him. Afterwards,
in the full light of day, such thoughts would seem
folly, but now, in the darkened room, anything was possible.
He did not believe in apparitions—ghosts were unknown in
Epsom—but he was suddenly unpleasantly aware that he
would give anything to be able to fling a glance back over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly the spell was broken. The tune died away,
revived for an instant, and then came to an abrupt end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli joined the circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so very much,” said Maradick. “That was
delightful.” But he was aware that, although the little tune
had been played again and again, it had already completely
passed from his memory. He could not recall it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the name of it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has no name,” Morelli answered, smiling. “It’s an
old tune that has been passed down from one to another.
There is something rather quaint in it, and it has many centuries
behind it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tony got up, and to Maradick’s intense astonishment
said: “I say, Maradick, it’s time we were going, it’s getting
awfully late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been willing to give the boy as long a rope as he
pleased, and now—but then he understood. It was the
perfect moment that must not be spoiled by any extension.
If they waited something might happen. He understood
the boy as far as that, at any rate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli pressed them to stay, but Tony was firm. He
went forward and said good night to Miss Minns, then he
turned to Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Miss Morelli,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” she answered, smiling. “Please come
again and tell me more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli’s good-bye was very cordial. “Whenever you
like,” he said, “drop in at any time, we shall be delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked back to the hotel in absolute silence. Tony’s
eyes were fixed on the hill in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed under the dark line of trees that led to
the hotel he gripped Maradick’s hand very hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he said, “help me!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MARADICK LEARNS THAT “GETTING A VIEW” MAY HAVE ITS</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>DANGERS AS WELL AS ITS REWARDS</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days after the arrival of the Lesters Lady Gale
arranged a picnic; a comprehensive, democratic picnic
that was to include everybody. Her motives may be put
down, if you will, to sociability, even, and you involve a
larger horizon, to philanthropy. “Everybody,” of course,
was in reality only a few, but it included the Lesters, the
Maradicks, and Mrs. Lawrence. It was to be a delightful
picnic; they were to drive to the top of Pender Callon, where
there was a wonderful view, then they were to have tea, and
then drive back in the moonlight.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Mrs. Maradick</span> (the letter went)—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would give me such pleasure if you and your husband
could come with us for a little Picnic at Pender Callon
to-morrow afternoon, weather permitting, of course. The
wagonette will come round about two-thirty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do hope you will be able to come.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Beatrice Gale</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick considered it a little haughtily. She was
sitting in the garden. Suddenly, as she turned the invitation
over in her mind, she saw her husband coming towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she said, as he came up to her, “I wanted to talk
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was looking as he always did—big, strong, red and
brown. Oh! so healthy and stupid!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did feel a new interest in him this morning, certainly.
His avoiding her so consistently during the week was unlike
him, was unusually strong. She even felt suddenly that she
would like him to be rude and violent to her again, as he had
been that other evening. Great creature! it was certainly
his métier to be rude and violent. Perhaps he would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held Lady Gale’s invitation towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A picnic.” she said coldly. “To-morrow; do you care
to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going?” he said, looking at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think that scarcely matters,” she answered
scornfully, “judging by the amount of interest you’ve taken
in me and my doings during the last week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he said, and he looked down at the ground,
“I have been a brute, a cad, all these days, treating you
like that. I have come to apologise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! the fool! She could have struck him with her hand!
It was to be the same thing after all, then. The monotonous
crawling back to her feet, the old routine of love and submission,
the momentary hope of strength and contradiction
strangled as soon as born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed a little. “Oh, you needn’t apologise,” she
said, “and, in any case, it’s a little late, isn’t it? Not that
you need mind about me. I’ve had a very pleasant week,
and so have the girls, even though their father <span class='it'>hasn’t</span> been
near them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he broke in upon her rapidly. “Oh! I’m ashamed
of myself,” he said, “you don’t know how ashamed. I think
the place had something to do with it, and then one was tired
and nervy a bit, I suppose; not,” he hastily added, “that I
want to make excuses, for there really aren’t any. I just
leave it with you. I was a beast. I promise never to break
out again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could a man! she thought, looking at him, and then,
how blind men were. Why couldn’t they see that it wasn’t
the sugar and honey that women were continually wanting,
or, at any rate, the right sort of woman!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him angrily. “We’d better leave the thing
there,” she said. “For heaven’s sake spare us any more
scenes. You were rude—abominably—I’m glad you’ve had
the grace at last to come and tell me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved as though she would get up, but he put out his
hand and stopped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Emmy, please,” he said, “let’s talk for a moment.
I’ve got things I want to say.” He cleared his throat, and
stared down the white shining path. Mrs. Lawrence appeared
coming towards them, then she saw them together and
turned hurriedly back. “I’ve been thinking, all these days,
about the muddle that we’ve made. My fault very largely,
I know, but I have so awfully wanted to put it right again.
And I thought if we talked——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of talking?” she broke in hastily;
“there’s nothing to say; it’s all as stale as anything could
be. You’re so extraordinarily dull when you’re in the
‘picking up the pieces’ mood; not content with behaving
like a second-rate bricklayer and then sulking for a week you
add to it by a long recital, ‘the virtues of an obedient wife’—a
little tiresome, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her nerves were all to pieces, she really wasn’t well, and
the heat was terrible; the sight of him sitting there with that
pathetic, ill-used look on his face, drove her nearly to madness.
To think that she was tied for life to so feeble a creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please,” he said, “I know that I’m tiresome and
stupid. But really I’ve been seeing things differently these
last few days. We might get along better. I’ll try; I know
it’s been largely my fault, not seeing things and not trying——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she broke in furiously, “for God’s sake stop it.
Isn’t it bad enough and tiresome enough for me already
without all this stuff! I’m sick of it, sick of it, I tell you.
Sick of the whole thing. You spoke your mind the other
night, I’ll speak mine now. You can take it or leave it.”
She rose from her chair and stood looking out to sea, her
hands clenched at her sides. “Oh! these years! these years!
Always the same thing. You’ve never stuck up to anything,
never fought anything, and it’s all been so tame. And now
you want us to go over the same old ground again, to patch
it up and go on as if we hadn’t had twenty long dreary years
of it and would give a good deal not to have another.” She
stopped and looked at him, smiling curiously. “Oh! James!
My poor dear, you’re such a bore. Try not to be so painfully
good; you might even be a little amusing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked slowly away towards the girls. She passed,
with them, down the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up the broken pieces of his thoughts and tried
to put them slowly together. His first thought of her and of
the whole situation was that it was hopeless, perfectly hopeless.
He had fancied, stupidly, blindly, that his having
moved included her moving too, quite without reason, as he
now thoroughly saw. She was just where they had both
been a week ago, she was even, from his neglect of her during
these last days, a little farther back; it was harder than ever
for her to see in line. His discovery of this affected him
very little. He was very slightly wounded by the things that
she had said to him, and her rejection of his advances so
finally and completely distressed him scarcely at all. As he
sat and watched the colours steal mistily across the sea he
knew that he was too happy at all the discoveries that he was
making to mind anything else. He was setting out on an
adventure, and if she would not come too it could simply not
be helped; it did not in the least alter the adventure’s excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was even with a new sense of freedom that he went
off, late that afternoon, to the town; he was like a boy just
out of school. He had no very vivid intention of going anywhere;
but lately the town had grown before him so that he
loved to stand and watch it, its life and movement, its colour
and romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He loved, above all, the market-place with its cobbled
stones over which rattled innumerable little carts, its booths,
its quaint and delightful chatter, its old grey tower. It was
one of the great features of his new view that places mattered,
that, indeed, they were symbols of a great and visible
importance; stocks and stones seemed to him now to be
possessed of such vitality that they almost frightened him,
they knew so much and had lived so long a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening light was over the market-place; the sun,
peering through a pillar of cloudless blue, cut sharply between
the straight walls of the Town Hall and a neighbouring
chimney, flung itself full upon the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It caught the stones and shot them with myriad lights;
it played with the fruit on the stall at the tower’s foot until
the apples were red as rubies and the oranges shone like
gold. It bathed it, caressed it, enfolded it, and showed the
modern things on every side that old friends were, after all,
the best, and that fine feathers did not always make the
finest birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the market-place was in shadow, purple in
the corners and crevices, the faintest blue in the higher air,
a haze of golden-grey in the central square. It was full
of people standing, for the most part, discussing the events
of the day; in the corner by the tower there was a Punch
and Judy show, and Maradick could hear the shrill cries
of Mr. Punch rising above the general chatter. Over everything
there was a delicious scent of all the best things in the
world—ripe orchards, flowering lanes, and the sharp pungent
breath of the sea; in the golden haze of the evening everything
seemed to be waiting, breathlessly, in spite of the noise
of voices, for some great moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick had never felt so perfectly in tune with the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed across to the Punch and Judy show, and stood
in a corner by the fruit stall under the tower and watched
Mr. Punch. That gentleman was in a very bad temper
to-night, and he banged with his stick at everything that he
could see; poor Judy was in for a bad time, and sank repeatedly
beneath the blows which should have slain an ox.
Toby looked on very indifferently until it was his turn, when
he bit furiously at Mr. Punch’s trousers and showed his
teeth, and choked in his frill and behaved like a most ferocious
animal. Then there came the policeman, and Mr.
Punch was carried, swearing and cursing, off to prison, but
in a moment he was back again, as perky as before, and committing
murders at the rate of two a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a fat baby, held aloft in its mother’s arms,
who watched the proceedings with the closest attention;
it was intensely serious, its thumb in its mouth, its double
chin wrinkling with excitement. Then a smile crept out
of its ears and across its cheeks; its mouth opened, and
suddenly there came a gurgle of laughter. It crowed with
delight, its head fell back on its nurse’s shoulder and its
eyes closed with ecstasy; then, with the coming of Jack Ketch
and his horrible gallows, it was solemn once more, and it
watched the villain’s miserable end with stern approval.
There were other babies in the crowd, and bottles had to be
swiftly produced in order to stay the cries that came from
so sudden an ending. The dying sun danced on Punch’s
execution; he dangled frantically in mid-air, Toby barked
furiously, and down came the curtain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady at the fruit stall had watched the performance
with great excitement. She was remarkable to look
at, and had been in the same place behind the same stall
for so many years that people had grown to take her as part
of the tower. She wore a red peaked hat, a red skirt, a
man’s coat of black velvet, and black mittens; her enormous
chin pointed towards her nose, which was hooked like an
eagle; nose and chin so nearly met that it was a miracle
how she ever opened her mouth at all. She nodded at
Maradick and smiled, whilst her hands clicked her needles
together, and a bit of grey stocking grew visibly before his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a fine show,” she said, “a fine show, and very true
to human nature.” Then suddenly looking past him, she
screamed in a voice like the whistle of a train: “A-pples
and O-ranges—fine ripe grapes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was so close to his ear that it startled him,
but he answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good for the children,” he said, shadowing his eyes
with his hand, for the sun was beating in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned towards him and waved a skinny finger. “I
ought to know,” she said, “I’ve buried ten, but they always
loved the Punch .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that’s many a year back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How old was she, he wondered? He seemed, in this town,
to be continually meeting people who had this quality of
youth; Tony, Morelli, Punch, this old woman, they gave one
the impression that they would gaily go on for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People live to a good old age here,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! it’s a wonderful town,” she said. “There’s nothing
like it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many’s the things I’ve seen, the tower
and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tower!” said Maradick, looking up at its grey
solemnity now flushing with the red light of the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been near it since I was a bit of a child,” she
said, leaning towards him so that her beak of a nose nearly
touched his cheek and her red hat towered over him. “We
lived by it once, and then I moved under it. We’ve been
friends, good friends, but it wants some considering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What wants considering mother?” said a voice, and
Maradick turned round; Punch was at his elbow. His show
was packed up and leant against the wall; by his side was
Toby, evidently pleased with the world in general, for every
part of his body was wagging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, sir,” said Punch, smiling from ear to ear.
“It’s a beautiful evening—the sea’s like a pome—what
wants considering mother? and I think I’ll have an apple,
if you don’t mind—one of your rosiest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She chose for him an enormous red one, which with one
squeeze of the hand he broke into half. Toby cocked an ear
and raised his eyes; he was soon munching for his life.
“What wants considering mother?” he said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many things,” she answered him shortly, “and it’ll be
tuppence, please.” Her voice rose into a shrill scream—“A-pples
and O-ranges and fine ripe grapes.” She sat back
in her chair and bent over her knitting, she had nothing
more to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been watching your show,” Maradick said, “and
enjoyed it more than many a play I’ve seen in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it went well to-night,” Punch said, “and there was
a new baby. It’s surprisin’ what difference a new baby
makes, even Toby notices it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new baby?” asked Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. A baby, you know, that ’asn’t seen the show before,
leastways in this world. You can always tell by the
way they take it.” Then he added politely, “And I hope
you like this town, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enormously,” Maradick answered. “I think it has
some quality, something that makes it utterly different from
anywhere else that I know. There is a feeling——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked across the market-place, and, through the cleft
between the ebony black of the towering walls, there shone
the bluest of evening skies, and across the space floated a
pink cushion of a cloud; towards the bend of the green hill
on the horizon the sky where the sun was setting was a bed
of primroses. “It is a wonderful place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I tell you sir,” said Punch, stroking one of Toby’s
ears, “there’s no place like it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve been in every town
in this kingdom, and some of them are good enough. But
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Maradick a moment and then he said, “Forgive
my mentioning it, sir, but you’ve got the feeling of the
place; you’ve caught the spirit, as one might say. We watch,
folks down here, you strangers up there at the ‘Man at
Arms.’ For the most part they miss it altogether. They
come for the summer with their boxes and their bags, they
bathe in the sea, they drive on the hill, and they’re gone.
Lord love you, why they might have been sleepin’.” He
spat contemptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you think that I have it?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got it right enough,” said Punch. “But then
you’re a friend of young Mr. Gale’s, and so you couldn’t help
having it; ’e’s got it more than anyone I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what exactly is—It?” asked Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” said Punch, “it’s not exactly easy to put it
into words, me bein’ no scholar.” He looked at the old
woman, but she was intent over her knitting. The light
of the sun had faded from the tower and left it cold and grey
against the primrose sky. “It’s a kind of Youth; seeing
things, you know, all freshly and with a new colour, always
caring about things as if you’d met ’em for the first time.
It doesn’t come of the asking, and there are places as well as
people that ’ave got it. But when a place or a person’s got
it, it’s like a match that they go round lighting other people’s
candles with.” He waved his arm in a comprehensive sweep.
“It’s all here, you know, sir, and Mr. Gale’s got it like
that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ’e’s lit your candle, so to speak, sir, if it isn’t
familiar, and now you’ve got to take the consequences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The consequences?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s got its dangers,” said Punch, “specially when
you take it suddenly; it’s like a fever, you know. And when
it comes to a gentleman of your age of life and settled habits,
well, it needs watchin’. Oh, there’s the bad and good of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick stared in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, I must be going,” said Punch. “Excuse me,
but I always must be talking. Good night, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” said Maradick. He watched the square,
stumpy figure pass, followed by the dog, across the misty
twilight of the market-place. Violet shadows lingered and
swept like mysterious creeping figures over the square. He
said good night to the old woman and struck up the hill to
the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consequence? Good and bad of it?” Anyhow, the
man hadn’t expressed it badly. That was his new view,
that strange new lightness of vision as though his pack had
suddenly been rolled from off his back. He was suddenly
enjoying every minute of his life, his candle had been lighted.
For a moment there floated across his mind his talk with his
wife that afternoon. Well, it could not be helped. If she
would not join him he must have his fun alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the hill he met Mrs. Lester. He had
seen something of her during the last two days and liked her.
She was amusing and vivacious; she had something of
Tony’s quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Mr. Maradick,” she cried, “hurrying back like
me to dinner? Isn’t it wicked the way that we leave the
most beautiful anything for our food?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must confess,” he answered, laughing, “that I
never thought of dinner at all. I just turned back because
things had, as it were, come to an end. The sun set, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard it strike seven,” she answered him, “and I said
Dinner. Although I was down on the beach watching the
most wonderful sea you ever saw, nothing could stop me, and
so back I came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been down here before?” he asked her. “To
stay, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes. Fred likes it as well as anywhere else, and
I like it a good deal better than most. He doesn’t mind so
very much, you know, where he is. He’s always living in
his books, and so real places don’t count.” She gave a little
sigh. “But they do count with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m enjoying it enormously,” he said, “it’s flinging the
years off from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know,” she answered, “but I’m almost afraid
of it for that very reason. It’s so very—what shall I say—champagney,
that one doesn’t know what one will do next.
Sometimes one’s spirits are so high that one positively longs
to be depressed. Why, you’d be amazed at some of the
things people, quite ordinary respectable people, do when
they are down here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned in at the gate she stopped and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care, Mr. Maradick,” she said, “I can see that
you are caught in the toils; it’s very dangerous for us, you
know, at our time of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she left him, laughing.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>FLY BEFORE THE STORM</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the most ripping rag,” said Tony, as he watched
people climb into the wagonette. “Things,” he added,
“will probably happen.” Lady Gale herself, as she watched
them arrange themselves, had her doubts; she knew, as very
few women in England knew, how to make things go, and
no situation had ever been too much for her, but the day
was dreadfully hot and there were, as she vaguely put it to
herself, “things in the air.” What these things were, she
could not, as yet, decide; but she hoped that the afternoon
would reveal them to her, that it would, indeed, show a good
deal that this last week had caused her to wonder about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief reasons for alarm were the Maradicks and
Mrs. Lawrence, without them it would have been quite a
family party; Alice, Rupert, Tony, and herself. She wondered
a little why she had asked the others. She had wanted
to invite Maradick, partly because she liked the man for
himself and partly for Tony’s sake; then, too, he held the
key to Tony now. He knew better than any of the others
what the boy was doing; he was standing guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so then, of course, she had to ask Mrs. Maradick.
She didn’t like the little woman, there was no question about
that, but you couldn’t ask one without the other. And then
she had to give her some one with whom to pair off, and so
she had asked Mrs. Lawrence; and there you were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it wasn’t only because of the Maradicks that the air
was thundery; the Lesters had quarrelled again. He sat in
the wagonette with his lips tightly closed and his eyes staring
straight in front of him right through Mrs. Maradick as
though she were non-existent. And Mrs. Lester was holding
her head very high and her cheeks were flushed. Oh!
they would both be difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She relied, in the main, on Tony to pull things through.
She had never yet known a party hang fire when he was
there; one simply couldn’t lose one’s temper and sulk with
Tony about the place, but then he too had been different during
this last week, and for the first time in his life she was not
sure of him. And then, again, there was Alice. That was
really worrying her very badly. She had come down with
them quite obviously to marry Tony; everyone had understood
that, including Tony himself. And yet ever since the
first evening of arrival things had changed, very subtly,
almost imperceptibly, so that it had been very difficult to
realise that it was only by looking back that she could see
how great the difference had been. It was not only, she
could see, that he had altered in himself, but that he had
altered also with regard to Alice. He struck her as being
even on his guard, as though he were afraid, poor boy, that
they would drive him into a position that he could not
honourably sustain. Of this she was quite sure, that whereas
on his coming down to Treliss he had fully intended to propose
to Alice within the fortnight, now, in less than a week
after his arrival, he did not intend to propose at all, was
determined, indeed, to wriggle as speedily as might be out
of the whole situation. Now there could be only one possible
explanation of such a change: that he had, namely, found
some one else. Who was it? When was it? Maradick
knew and she would trust him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what surprised her most in the whole affair was her
feeling about it all, that she rather liked it. That was most
astonishing, because, of course, Tony’s marriage with Alice
was from every point of view a most suitable and admirable
business; it was the very thing. But she had looked on it,
in spite of herself, as a kind of chest into which Tony’s youth
and vitality were inevitably going; a splendid chest with
beautiful carving and studded with golden nails, but nevertheless
a chest. Alice was so perfectly right for anybody
that she was perfectly wrong for Tony; Lady Gale before the
world must approve and even further the affair, but Lady
Gale the mother of Tony had had her doubts, and perhaps this
new something, whatever it might be, was romantic, exciting,
young and adventurous. Mr. Maradick knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is Mrs. Maradick’s view of the drive that must be
recorded, because it was, in fact, round her that everything
revolved. The reason for her prominence was Rupert, and
it was he who, quite unconsciously and with no after knowledge
of having done anything at all, saved the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was looking very cool and rather handsome; so was
Mrs. Maradick. She was indeed by far the coolest of them
all in very pale mauve and a bunch of carnations at her
breast and a broad grey hat that shaded her eyes. He had
admired her from the first, and to-day everyone else seemed
hot and flustered in comparison. Neither Alice nor Mrs.
Lester were at their best, and Mrs. Lawrence was obviously
ill at ease, but Mrs. Maradick leaned back against the cushions
and talked to him with the most charming little smile
and eyes of the deepest blue. He had expected to find the
afternoon boring in the extreme, but now it promised to be
amusing, very amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick had come out in the spirit of conquest.
She would show these people, all of them, what they had
missed during these last two weeks. They should compare
her husband and herself, and she had no fear of the result;
this was her chance, and she meant to seize it. She never
looked at him, and they had not, as yet, spoken, but she was
acutely conscious of his presence. He was sitting in a grey
flannel suit, rather red and hot, next to Mrs. Lester. He
would probably try and use the afternoon as the means for
another abject apology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was irritated, nevertheless, with herself for thinking
about him at all; she had never considered him before. Why
should she do so now? She glanced quickly across for a
moment at him. How she hated that Mrs. Lester! There
was a cat for you, if ever there was one!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had climbed the hill, and now a breeze danced about
them; and there were trees, tall and shining birch, above
their heads. On their right lay the sea, so intensely blue
that it flung into the air a scent as of a wilderness of blue
flowers, a scent of all the blue things that the world has ever
known. No breeze ruffled it, no sails crossed its surface; it
was so motionless that one would have expected, had one
flung a pebble, to have seen it crack like ice. Behind them
ran the road, a white, twisting serpent, down to the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town itself shone like a jewel in a golden ring of
corn; its towers and walls gleamed and flashed and sparkled.
The world lay breathless, with the hard glazed appearance
that it wears when the sun is very hot. The colour was so
intense that the eye rested with relief on a black clump of
firs clustered against the horizon. Nothing moved save the
carriage; the horses crawled over the brow of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s awfully funny,” said Mrs. Maradick, leaning
over and smiling at Rupert. “Because I feel just as you
do about it. We can’t often come up, of course, and the last
train to Epsom’s so dreadfully late that unless it’s something
<span class='it'>really</span> good, you know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dreadfully boring anyhow,” said Rupert, “turning
out at night and all that sort of rot, and generally the same
old play, you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Give me musical comedy—dancing
and stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you young men!” said Mrs. Maradick, “we know
you’re all the same. And I must say I enjoyed <span class='it'>‘The Girl
and the Cheese</span>’ the other day, positively the only thing I’ve
seen for ages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the other side Mrs. Lawrence could be heard making
attack on Mr. Lester. “It was really too awfully sweet of
you to put it that way, Mr. Lester. It was just what I’d been
feeling, but couldn’t put into words; and when I came across
it in your book I said to myself, ‘There, that’s just what
I’ve been feeling all along.’ I simply love your book, Mr.
Lester. I feel as if it had been written specially for me,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lester flushed with annoyance. He hated, beyond
everything, that people should talk to him about his books,
and now this silly woman! It was such a hot day, and he
had quarrelled with his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what I’ve really always so often wanted to ask you,”
pursued Mrs. Lawrence, “is whether you took Mrs. Abbey
in ‘To Paradise’ from anyone? I think you must have
done; and I know some one so exactly like her that I couldn’t
help wondering—Mrs. Roland Temmett—she lives in
Hankin Street, No. 3 I think it is. Do you know her? If
you don’t you must meet her, because she’s the very image,
exactly like. You know in that chapter when she goes down
to poor Mr. Elliot——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was too much for Mr. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never met her,” he said brusquely, and his lips
closed as though he never meant to open them again. Mrs.
Lester watched them and was amused. She knew how her
husband hated it; she could even sympathise with him, but
it would punish him for having been so horrid to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She herself was rapidly recovering her temper. It was
such a lovely day that it was impossible to be cross for long,
and then her husband had often been cross and disagreeable
before, it wasn’t as though it were anything new. What
a dreadful woman that Mrs. Maradick was! Why had Lady
Gale invited her? Poor Mr. Maradick! She rather liked
him, his size and strength and stolidity, but how dreadful
to be tied to such a woman for life! Even worse, she reflected,
than to be tied for life to a man such as her own
special treasure! Oh! our marriage system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned round to Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s better, thank you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My temper,” she answered. “It was just the Devil
when we started. I was positively fuming. You must have
noticed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been perfectly charming,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s very nice of you to say so, but I assure you
it was through my clenched teeth. My hubby and I had
a tiff before we started, and it was hot, and my maid did
everything wrong. Oh! little things! but all enough to upset
me. But it’s simply impossible to stay cross with a view
and a day like this. I don’t suppose you know,” she said,
looking up at him, “what it is to be bad-tempered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” He laughed. “Don’t I? I’m always in a bad
temper all the year round. One has to be in business, it
impresses people; it’s the only kind of authority that the
office-boy understands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you get awfully tired of it all?” she asked him.
“Blotting-paper, I mean, and pens and sealing-wax?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I never used to think about it. One lived by
rule so. There were regular hours at which one did things
and always every day the same regular things to do. But
now, after this fortnight, it will, I think, be hard. I shall
remember things and places, and it will be difficult to settle
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him critically. “Yes, you’re not the sort
of man to whom business would be enough. Some men can
go on and never want anything else at all. I know plenty of
men like that, but you’re not one of them.” She paused
for a moment and then said suddenly, “But oh, Mr. Maradick,
why did you come to Treliss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he said, vaguely echoing her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of all places in the world. There never was a place
more unsettling; whatever you’ve been before Treliss will
make you something different now, and if anything’s ever
going to happen to you it will happen here. However, have
your holiday, Mr. Maradick, have it to the full. I’m going
to have mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had arrived. The wagonette had drawn up in front
of a little wayside inn, “The Hearty Cow,” having for its
background a sweeping moor of golden gorse; the little brown
house stood like a humble penitent on the outskirts of some
royal crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone got down and shovelled rugs and baskets and
kettles; everyone protested and laughed and ran back to see
if there was anything left behind, and ran on in front to
look at the view. At the turn of the brow of the hill Maradick
drew a deep breath. He did not think he had ever seen
anything so lovely before. On both sides and behind him
the gorse flamed; in front of him was the sea stretching, a
burning blue, for miles; against the black cliffs in the distance
it broke in little waves of hard curling white. They
had brought with them a tent that was now spread over their
heads to keep off the sun, they crowded round the unpacking
of the baskets. Conversation was general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, paté de foie gras, chicken, lobster salad, that’s right.
No, Tony, wait a moment. Don’t open them yet, they’re
jam and things. Oh! there’s the champagne. Please, Mr.
Lester, would you mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I said to him that if he couldn’t behave at a dance
he’d better not come at all—yes, look at the view, isn’t it
lovely?—better not come at all; don’t you think I was perfectly
right, Mr. Gale? Too atrocious, you know, to
speak——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bounder! Can’t stand fellows that are too familiar,
Mrs. Maradick. I knew a chap once——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh Lord! Look out! It’s coming! My word, Lester,
you nearly let us have it. It’s all right, mother, the situation’s
saved, but it was a touch and go. I say, what stuff!
Look out, Milly, you’ll stick your boot into the pie. No,
it’s all right. It was only my consideration for your dress,
Milly, not a bit for the pie; only don’t put your foot into it.
Hullo, Alice, old girl, where have you been all this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last was Tony, his face red with his exertions, his
collar off and his shirt open at the neck. When he saw Alice,
however, he stopped unpacking the baskets and came over to
her. “I say,” he said, bending down to her, “come for a
little stroll while they’re unpacking the flesh-pots. There’s
a view just round the corner that will fairly make you open
your eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out together. He put his arm through hers.
“What is the matter, Miss Alice Du Cane?” he said. Then
as she gave no answer, he said, “What’s up, old girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! nothing’s up,” she said, looking down and digging
her parasol into the ground. “Only it’s hot and, well, I
suppose I’m not quite the thing. I don’t think Treliss suits
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I say, I’m so sorry,” he said. “I’d noticed these
last few days that you were a bit off colour. I’d been wondering
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s nothing,” she said, driving her parasol into the
path still more furiously. “Only—I hate Treliss. I hate
it. You’re all awfully good to me, of course, but I think
I’d better go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go?” he said blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, up to Scotland or somewhere. I’m not fit company
for anyone as I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I say, I’m sorry.” He looked at her in dismay.
“You said something before about it, but I thought it was
only for the moment. I’ve been so jolly myself that I’ve
not thought about other people. But why don’t you like
the place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, I couldn’t tell you. I know it’s awfully
ungrateful of me to complain when Lady Gale has given
me such a good time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve no explanation at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It's silly of me."</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared out to sea, and she knew quite well that the
explanation was of the simplest, she was in love with
Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it had come upon her she did not know. She had
certainly not been in love with him when she had first
come down to Treliss. The idea of marrying him had been
entertained agreeably, and had seemed as pleasant a way
of settling as any other. One had to be fixed and placed
some time, and Tony was a very safe and honourable person
to be placed with. There were things that she would have
altered, of course; his very vitality led him into a kind
of indiscriminate appreciation of men and things that meant
change and an inability to stick to things, but she had faced
the whole prospect quite readily and with a good deal of
tolerance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, within the week, everything had changed. She
wondered, hating herself for the thought, whether it had
been because he had shown himself less keen; he hadn’t
sought her out in quite the way that he had once done, he
had left her alone for days together. But that could not
have been all; there was something else responsible. There
was some further change in him, something quite apart from
his relation to her, that she had been among the first to
recognise. He had always had a delightful youth and vitality
that people had been charmed by, but now, during the
last week, there had been something more. It was as though
he had at last found the thing for which he had so long been
looking. There had been something or some one outside all
of them, their set, that he had been seeing and watching all
the time; she had seen his eyes sparkle and his mouth smile
at some thought or vision that they most certainly had not
given him. And this new discovery gave him a strength
that he had lacked before; he seemed to have in her eyes
a new grandeur, and perhaps it was this that made her love
him. But no, it was something more, something that she
could only very vaguely and mistily put down to the place.
It was in the air, and she felt that if she could only get
away from Treliss, with its sea and its view and its crooked
town, she would get straight again and be rid of all this
contemptible emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had always prided herself on her reserve, on the
control of her emotions, on her contempt for animal passion,
and now she could have flung her arms round Tony’s neck
and kissed his eyes, his hair, his mouth. She watched him,
his round curly head, his brown neck, the swing of his
shoulders, his splendid stride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s sit down here,” he said; “they can’t see us now.
I’m not going to help ’em any more. They’ll call us when
they’re ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down on a rock and faced the sweep of the sea,
curved like a purple bow in the hands of some mighty archer.
He flung himself down on to his chest and looked up at her,
his face propped on his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Alice, old girl,” he said, “this is the first decent
talk we’ve had for days. I suppose it’s been my fault. I’m
awfully sorry, and I really don’t know how the time’s gone;
there’s been a lot to do, somehow, and yet it’s hard to say
exactly what one’s done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been with Mr. Maradick,” she said almost
fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up at her, surprised at her tone. “Why, yes,
I suppose I have. He’s a good chap, Maradick. I have
been about with him a good bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t quite see,” she said slowly, looking down at the
ground, “what the attraction is. He’s nice enough, of
course; a nice old man, but rather dull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know about old, Alice. He’s much younger
than you’d think, and he’s anything but dull. That’s only
because you don’t know him. He is quiet when other people
are there; but he’s awfully true and straight. And you know
as one gets older, without being priggish about it, one chooses
one’s friends for that sort of thing, not for superficial things
a bit. I used to think it mattered whether they cared about
the same ideas and were—well, artistic, you know. But
that’s all rot; what really matters is whether they’ll stick to
you and last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing I always said about you, Tony,” she answered,
“is that you don’t, as you say, stick. It’s better,
you know, to be off with the old friends before you are on
with the new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I say!” He could scarcely speak for astonishment.
“Alice! what’s the matter? Why, you don’t think
I’ve changed about you, do you? I know—these past few
days——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please don’t apologise, Tony,” she said, speaking
very quickly. “I’m not making complaints. If you would
rather be with Mr. Maradick, do. Make what friends you
like; only when one comes down to stay, one expects to see
something of you, just at meals, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never seen her like this before. Alice, the most
self-contained of girls, reserving her emotions for large and
abstract causes and movements, and never for a moment revealing
any hint of personal likes or dislikes, never, so far as
he had seen, showing any pleasure at his presence or complaining
of his absence; and now, this!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I say!” he cried again, “I’m most awfully sorry.
It’s only been a few days—I know it was jolly rude. But
the place has been so ripping, so beautiful, that I suppose
I didn’t think about people much. I’ve been awfully happy,
and that makes one selfish, I suppose. But I say,” he put a
hand on her dress, “please don’t be angry with me, Alice,
old girl. We’ve been chums for ages now, and when one’s
known some one a jolly long time it isn’t kind of necessary
to go on seeing them every day, one goes on without that,
takes it on trust, you know. I knew that you were there and
that I was there and that nothing makes any difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The touch of his hand made her cheeks flame. “I’m
sorry,” she said, almost in a whisper, “I don’t know why
I spoke like that; of course we’re chums, only I’ve been
a bit lonely; rotten these last few days, I’m sure I don’t
know why.” She paused for a moment and then went on:
“What it really is, is having to change suddenly. Oh,
Tony, I’m such a rotter! You know how I talked about
what I’d do if I were a man and the way I could help and
the way you ought to help, and all the rest of it; well; that’s
all gone suddenly—I don’t know why or when—and there’s
simply nothing else there. You won’t leave me quite alone
the rest of the time, Tony, please? It isn’t that I want you
so awfully much, you know, but there isn’t anyone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! we’ll have a splendid time,” he said. “You must
get to know Maradick, Alice. He’s splendid. He doesn’t
talk much, but he’s so awfully genuine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got up. “You don’t describe him very well, Tony;
all the same, genuine people are the most awful bores, you
never know where you are. Well, forgive my little bit of
temper. We ought to get back. They’ll be wondering where
we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as they strolled back she was very quiet. She had
found out what she wanted to know. There <span class='it'>was</span> some one
else. She had watched his face as he looked at the sea;
of course that accounted for the change. Who was she?
Some fisher-girl in the town, perhaps some girl at a shop.
Well, she would be no rival to anyone. She wouldn’t fight
over Tony’s body; she had her pride. It was going to be a
hard time for her; it would be better for her to go away,
but that would be difficult. People would talk; she had
better see it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s simply too dreadfully hot in the sun,” Tony was
conscious of Mrs. Lawrence saying as he joined them. He
took it as a metaphor that she was sitting with her back to
the sea and her eyes fixed upon the chicken. He wanted to
scream, “Look at the gorse, you fool!” but instead he took
a plate and flung himself down beside Mrs. Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded at him gaily. “You naughty boy! You left
us to unpack; you don’t deserve to have anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Mrs. Maradick, I stayed until I was in the way.
Too many cooks, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched everyone, and detected an air of cheerfulness
that had certainly not been there before. Perhaps it was
the lunch; at any rate he was hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked, waving a piece of bread and butter. “You
people don’t deserve anything. You ought to go and see a
view before eating; grace before meat. Alice and I have
done our duty and shall now proceed to enjoy our food twice
as much as the rest of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I think it’s too bad, that gorse,” said Mrs. Maradick,
with a little pout and a flash of the eye towards Rupert
Gale. “It puts all one’s colours out.” She gave her
mauve a self-satisfied pat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Emmy dear! You look perfectly sweet!” ecstatically
from Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Mr. Lester spoke, leaning forward and looking
at Mrs. Maradick very seriously. “Have you thought,
Mrs. Maradick, whether perhaps you don’t put the gorse
out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Mr. Lester! How cruel! Poor little me! Now,
Mr. Gale, do stand up for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert looked at the gorse with a languid air. “It simply
don’t stand a chance,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talking about gorse,” began Mrs. Lawrence. She was
always telling long stories about whose success she was in
great doubt. This doubt she imparted to her audience, with
the result that her stories always failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This one failed completely, but nobody seemed to mind.
The highest spirits prevailed, and everyone was on the best
of terms with everyone else. Lady Gale was delighted. She
had thought that it would go off all right, but not quite so
well as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course it was largely due to Tony. She watched him
as he gathered people in, made them laugh, and brought the
best out of them. It was a kind of “Open Sesame” that he
whispered to everyone, a secret that he shared with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what Lady Gale didn’t recognise was that it was all
very much on the surface; nobody really had changed at all.
She might have discovered that fact from her own experience
had she thought about it. For instance, she didn’t care for
Mrs. Maradick any more than before; she liked her, indeed,
rather less, but she smiled and laughed and said “<span class='it'>Dear</span> Mrs.
Maradick.” Everyone felt the same. They would have embraced
their dearest enemies; it was in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester even addressed her husband—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Ted dear, no more meringues. You know it’s bad
for you, and you’ll be sorry to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her rather gloomily, and then turned and
watched the gorse. Maradick suddenly leaned over and
spoke to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emmy dear, do you remember that day at Cragholt?
It was just like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do,” she said, nodding gaily back at him.
“There was that funny Captain Bassett.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Such a nice
man, dear Lady Gale. I wonder if you know him. Captain
Godfrey Bassett.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Such fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Lady Gale, “if that is one of the
Bassetts of Hindhurst. There was a Captain Bassett——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick watched the golden curtain of gorse. The scent
came to him; bees hummed in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I like being by the sea, you know. But to be <span class='it'>on</span>
it; I’ve crossed the Atlantic seven times and been ill every
time. There is a stuff called—Oh! I forget—Yansfs. Yes,
you can’t pronounce it—You-are-now-secure-from-sea-sickness—it
wasn’t any good as far as I was concerned, but then I
think you ought to take it before——”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>This</span> was his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester suddenly spoke to him. “You are very silent,
Mr. Maradick. Take me for a stroll some time, won’t you?
No, not now. I’m lazy, but later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned away from him before he could reply, and
leaned over to her husband. Then he saw that Tony was at
his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down and bathe,” the boy said, “now. No, it isn’t
bad for you, really. That’s all tommy-rot. Besides, we
mayn’t be able to get away later.” They left the tent together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it champagne?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this amiability. I was as gruff as a—as my ordinary
self—coming, and then suddenly I could have played a penny
whistle; why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I don’t know!” said Tony, flinging his arms
about. “I’m much too happy to care. Maradick, I’ve been
seeing her, here in the gorse—wonderful—divine. We will
go back to-morrow; yes, we must. Of course you’ve got to
come. As to everybody’s good temper, that doesn’t mean
anything. The spirits of the place have their games, you
know, and there we are. Everybody will be awfully cross
at tea. And you know it <span class='it'>is</span> cheek! For us all to go and
plant our tent and eat our chicken in the middle of a view
like this. And they’ll leave paper bags about, and they’ll
pop ginger-beer. I don’t mind betting that the gods play
some games before they’ve done with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed down the rocks to a little cove that lay
nestling under the brow of the hill. The sand was white,
with little sparkles in it where the sun caught the pebbles;
everything was coloured with an intensity that hurt the eye.
The cove was hemmed in by brown rocks; a little bird hopped
along the sand, then rose with a little whirl of pleasure above
their heads and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They flung off their clothes with an entire disregard of
possible observers. A week ago Maradick would have died
rather than do such a thing; a bathing-machine and a complete
bathing-suit had been absolute essentials, now they
really never entered his head. If he had thought of it at all,
they would have seemed to him distinctly indecent, a kind of
furtive winking of the eye, an eager disavowal of an immorality
that was never there at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Maradick felt the water about his body his years fell
from him like Pilgrim’s pack. He sank down, with his eyes
for a moment on the burning sky, and then gazing through
depths of green water. As he cleaved it with his arm it
parted and curled round his body like an embrace; for a
moment he was going down and down and down, little
diamond bubbles flying above him, then he was up again,
and, for an instant, the dazzling white of the cove, the brown
of the rocks, the blue of the sky, encircled him. Then he
lay on his back and floated. His body seemed to leave him,
and he was something utterly untrammelled and free; there
were no Laws, no Creeds, no Arguments, nothing but a wonderful
peace and contentment, an absolute union with something
that he had been searching for all his life and had
never found until now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Obey we Mother Earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mother Earth.” He lay,
smiling, on her breast. Little waves came and danced beneath
him, touching his body with a caress as they passed
him; he rose and fell, a very gentle rocking, as of some
mother with her child. He could not think, he could remember
nothing; he only knew that he had solved a riddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he struck out to sea. Before him it seemed to spread
without end or limit; it was veiled in its farthest distance
by a thin purple haze, and out of this curtain the blue white-capped
waves danced in quick succession towards him. He
struck out and out, and as he felt his body cut through the
water a great exultation rose in him that he was still so
strong and vigorous. Every part of him, from the crown of
his head to the soles of his feet, seemed clean and sound and
sane. Oh! Life! with its worries and its dirty little secrets
and its petty moralities! and the miserable pessimistic sauntering
in a melancholy twilight through perpetual graveyards!
Let them swim, let them swim!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shouted to Tony, “It’s great. One could go on for
ever!” He dived for a moment downward, and saw the
great white curve of his body from his foot to the hip, the
hard smooth strength of the flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned slowly back. The white beach, the brown
rocks, and the blue sky held out hands to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All those people,” he shouted to Tony, “up there, eating,
sleeping, when they might be in this!” Mrs. Lester, he
knew, would have liked it. He thought for a moment of his
wife, the dresses she would need and the frills. He could
see her stepping delicately from the bathing-machine; her
little scream as her feet touched the water, “Oh Jim! it’s
cold!” He laughed as he waded back on to the beach.
The pebbles burnt hot under his feet, and the sand clung to
his toes; he dug his legs deep into it. The sun curled about
his body and wrapped him, as it were, in a robe of its own
glorious colour. He could feel it burning on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony joined him, panting. “Oh! my word! I’ve never
had such a bathe, never! I could have stayed in for ever!
But they’d be coming to look for us, and that wouldn’t
do. I say, run round with me! I’ll beat you five times
round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They raced round the beach. The sun, the wind, and
the waves seemed to go with them; the water fell from them
as they ran, and at last they flung themselves dry and breathless
on to the hot sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst they dressed, Tony dealt with the situation more
practically and in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are going to be a lot of difficulties, I’m afraid,”
he said, as he stood with his shirt flapping about his legs,
and his hands struggling with his collar. “In the first
place, there’s mother. As I told you, she’s not got to know
anything about it, because the minute she hears anything
officially, of course, she’ll have to step in and ask about it,
and then there’ll be no end of trouble with the governor
and everybody. It’s not that she disapproves really, you
know—your being there makes that all right; but she hasn’t
got to realise it until it’s done. She won’t ask anything
about it, but of course she can’t help wondering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope it is all right,” said Maradick anxiously.
“My being a kind of moral danger-signal makes one nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! she trusts you,” said Tony confidently. “That’s
why it’s so perfectly splendid your being there. And then,”
went on Tony, “they are all of them wondering what we are
at. You see, Treliss has that effect on people, or at any rate
it’s having that kind of effect on us here and now. Everybody
is feeling uneasy about something, and they are most
of them putting it down to me. Things always do happen
when you jumble a lot of people together in a hotel, the
gods can’t resist a game; and when you complicate it by putting
them in Treliss! My word!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s the immediate complication?” asked Maradick.
The water had made his hair curl all over his head,
and his shirt was open at the neck and his sleeves rolled up
over his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the most immediate one,” said Tony slowly, “is
Alice, Miss Du Cane. She was talking to me before lunch.
It’s rather caddish to say anything about it, but I tell you
everything, you know. Well, she seemed to think I’d been
neglecting her and was quite sick about it. She never is
sick about anything, because she’s much too solid, and so I
don’t know what’s set her off this time. She suspects a
lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the funny thing is that they should worry at all.
Before, when I’ve done anything they’ve always said, ‘Oh!
Tony again!’ and left it at that. Now, when I’ve done
nothing, they all go sniffing round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick, “that’s the really funny thing; that
nothing has been done for them to sniff at, yet. I suppose,
as a matter of fact, people have got so little to do in a hotel
that they worry about nothing just to fill up time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stretched his arms and yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Tony, “it’s the place. Whom the gods wish
to send mad they first send to Treliss. It’s in the air. Ask
that old fellow, Morelli.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why Morelli?” Maradick asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s absurd of me,” said Tony. “But I don’t mind
betting that he knows all about it. He’s uncanny; he knows
all about everything. It’s just as if he set us all dancing
to his tune like the Pied Piper.” He laughed. “Just
think! all of us dancing; you and I, mother, father, Alice,
Rupert, the Lesters, Mrs. Maradick, Mrs. Lawrence—and
Janet!” he added suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet,” he said, catching Maradick’s arm and walking
up the beach. “Can’t you see her dancing? that hair and
those eyes! Janet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sleepy,” said Maradick unsympathetically. “I shall
lie with my head in the gorse and snore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was feeling absolutely right in every part of his body;
his blood ran in his veins like a flame. He hummed a little
tune as he climbed the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why! that’s Morelli’s tune,” said Tony, “I’d been trying
to remember it; the tune he played that night,” and then
suddenly they saw Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat on a rock that had been cut into a seat in the
side of the hill. She could not see the beach immediately
below because the cliff projected in a spreading cloud of gorse,
but the sea lay for miles in front of her, and the gold of the
hill struck sharp against the blue. She herself sat perched
on the stone, the little wind blowing her hair about her face.
She was staring out to sea and did not see them until they
were right upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony shouted “Hullo, Milly,” and she turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been bathing,” he said. “It was the most
stupendous bathe that there has ever been.” Then he added,
“Why are you alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rest went to see a church on a hill or something,
but I didn’t want anything except the view; but Lady Gale
is still there, at the tent. She told me to tell you if I saw
you to come to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are.” He passed singing up the hill. Maradick
stood in front of her, his cap in his hand, then she made
room for him on her seat and he sat beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A view like this,” she said, “makes one want very much
to be good. I don’t suppose that you ever want to be anything
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some difference between wanting and being,”
he answered sententiously. “Besides, I don’t suppose I’m
anything real, neither good nor bad, just indifferent like
three-fourths of the human race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke rather bitterly, and she looked at him. “I think
you’re anything but indifferent,” she said, nodding her head.
“I think you’re delightful. You’re just one of the big,
strong, silent men of whom novels are full; and I’ve never
met one before. I expect you could pick me up with one
finger and hurl me into the sea. Women like that, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be afraid that I shall do it,” he said, laughing.
“I have been bathing and am as weak as a kitten; and
that also accounts for my untidiness,” he added. He had
been carrying his coat over his shoulder, and his shirt was
open at the neck and his sleeves rolled up over his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not speak again for several minutes. She was
looking at the view with wide-open, excited eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned round and laid her hand upon his arm.
“Oh! I don’t expect you’ve needed it as I have done,” she
said, “all this colour; I’m drinking it in and storing it so
that I can fill all the drab days that are coming with it.
Drab, dull, stupid days; going about and seeing people you
don’t want to see, doing things you don’t want to do, saying
things you don’t want to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! one has to. One can’t expect to be at Treliss for
ever. It’s really bad for one to come here, because it always
makes one discontented and unsettles one. Last year,”
she smiled at the recollection, “was most unsettling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he answered, “I’ve got to go back to the office,
you know. It will do me good to have these days to remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent again; then the grasp on his arm tightened
and she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Mr. Maradick, I am so unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved a little away from her. Here were more confidences
coming! Why had all the world suddenly taken it
into its incautious head to trust him with its secrets? He!
Maradick! whom no one had ever dreamt of trusting with
anything before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t want to bother you. It won’t bother you,
will it? Only it is such a rest and a comfort to be able to
tell some one.” She spoke with a little catch in her voice,
but she was thinking of the year before when she had trusted
Captain Stanton, “dear old Reggie,” with similar confidences;
and there had been Freddie Stapylton before that.
Well, they had all been very nice about it, and she was sure
that this big man with the brown neck and the curly hair
would be just as nice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but you will be a friend of mine, won’t you?” she
said. “A woman wants a friend, a good, sensible, strong
friend to whom she can tell things, and I have nobody. It
will be such a comfort if I can talk to you sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Providence seemed to have designed him as a kind of general
nursemaid to a lot of irresponsible children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that’s good of you.” She gave a little sigh and
stared out to sea. “Of course, I’m not complaining, other
women have had far worse times, I know that; but it is the
loneliness that hurts so. If there is only one person who understands
it all it will make such a difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester was not at all insincere. She liked Maradick
very much, and her having liked Captain Stanton and Mr.
Stapylton before him made no difference at all. Those others
had been very innocent flirtations and no harm whatever
had come of them, and then Treliss was such an exciting
place that things always did happen. It must also be remembered
that she had that morning quarrelled with her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she said, “I suppose I was always rather a
romantic girl. I loved colour and processions and flowers
and the Roman Catholic Church. I used to go into the
Brompton Oratory and watch the misty candles and listen
to them singing from behind the altars and sniff the incense.
And then I read Gautier and Merimée and anything about
Spain. And then I went to Italy, and I thought I could
never leave it with the dear donkeys and Venice and carnivals,
but we had to get back for Ascot. Oh! I suppose it
was all very silly and like lots of other girls, but it was all
very genuine, Mr. Maradick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so sweet of you to understand,” she said. “Well,
like most girls, I crowded all these dreams into marriage.
That was going to do everything for me. Oh! he was to be
such a hero, and I was to be such a wife to him. Dear me!
How old it makes one feel when one thinks of those girlish
days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick only thought that she looked very young
indeed, Tony’s age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I read some of Fred’s essays; Mr. Lester, you
know. They used to come out in the <span class='it'>Cornhill</span>, and I thought
them simply wonderful. They said all that I had been thinking,
and they were full of that colour that I loved so. The
more I read them the more I felt that here was my hero, the
man whom I could worship all my days. Poor old Fred,
fancy my thinking that about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick thought of Mr. Lester trailing with bent back
and languid eye over the gorse, and wondered too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then I met him at a party; one of those literary
parties that I used to go to. He was at his best that night
and he talked wonderfully. We were introduced, and—well,
there it all was. It all happened in a moment. I
couldn’t in the least tell you how; but I woke one morning
and, like Mr. Somebody or other, a poet I think, found myself
married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here there was a dramatic pause. Maradick didn’t know
what to say. He felt vaguely that sympathy was needed,
but it was difficult to find the right words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That changed me,” Mrs. Lester went on in a low voice
with a thrill in it, “from an innocent warm-hearted girl into
a woman—a suffering, experienced woman. Oh! Mr. Maradick,
you know what marriage is, the cage that it can be;
at least, if you haven’t experienced it, and I sincerely hope
you haven’t, you can imagine what it is. A year of it was
enough to show me how cruel life was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick felt a little uncomfortable. His acquaintance
with Mrs. Lester had been a short one, and in a little time
he was going back to have tea with Mr. Lester; he had
seemed a harmless kind of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please,” she went on quickly, “don’t think that I’m
unhappy. I don’t curse fate or do anything silly like that.
I suppose there are very few persons who find marriage
exactly what they expect it to be. I don’t complain. But
oh! Mr. Maradick, never marry an author. Of course you
can’t—how silly of me!—but I should like you to understand
a little what I have felt about it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried clumsily to find words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of us,” he said, “must discover as we get on that
things aren’t quite what we thought they would be. And
of marriage especially. One’s just got to make up one’s
mind to it. And then I think there’s a lot to be grateful
for if there’s only one person, man or woman, to whom one
matters; who, well, sticks to one and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I know,” she sighed reminiscently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I mean is that it doesn’t so much matter what
that person is, stupid or ugly or anything, if they really
care. There isn’t so much of that steady affection going
about in the world that we can afford to disregard it when
it comes. Dear me!” he added with a laugh, “how sentimental
I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” she said eagerly. “That’s just it; if Fred
did care like that, oh dear, how wonderful it would be! But
he doesn’t. I don’t really exist for him at all. He thinks
so much about his books and the people in them that real
people aren’t there. At first I thought that I could help
him with his work, read to him and discuss it with him;
and I know that there were a lot of grammatical mistakes,
but he wouldn’t let me do anything. He shut me out. I
was no use to him at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clenched her hands and frowned. As a matter of
fact she got on with him very well, but they had quarrelled
that morning, over nothing at all, of course. And then
it made things more exciting if you thought that you
hated your husband, and Mr. Maradick was a fine-looking
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he thought how young she was and what a dreary
stretch of years was before her. He knew what his own
married life had been: fifteen years of disillusion and misunderstanding
and sullen silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so sorry,” he said, and he looked at her very
sympathetically. “I can understand a little how hard it
is. We don’t all of us make lucky shots, but then we have
just got to grin and bear it; cold sort of comfort, I know,
and if it really does comfort you to feel that you have a
friend you may count on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She liked his sympathy, the dear old strong thing! and
at any rate she would pull Fred pretty sharply out of his
books for once. Captain Stanton and Mr. Stapylton had had
just that effect; she had never known Fred so charming as he
was after their final exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at her with a fatherly smile. “We’ll
be friends,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, her voice trembling
a little. “I felt that you would understand. I cannot tell
you how it has helped me, this little talk of ours. Now
I suppose we ought to be going back or they’ll be wondering
where we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he stood thanking God for a wonderful world. At
last there were people who wanted him, Tony and Mrs.
Lester; and at the same time he had begun to see everything
with new eyes. It was his view! They talked of life being
over at forty; why, it had never begun for him until
now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked back to the tent, and he talked to her gravely
about helping others and the real meaning of life. “He
can,” she thought, “be most awfully dull, but he’s a dear
old thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expedition in search of a church had scarcely been a
success, and when one considers the members of it there is
little room to wonder. Tony had been right about the gods.
They had seen fit to play their games round the tent on the
gorse, and the smiles with which they had regarded the
luncheon-party speedily changed to a malicious twinkle.
Everyone had been too pleasant to be true, and, after the
meal was over, the atmosphere became swiftly ominous. For
one thing, Tony had departed with Maradick for a bathe,
and his absence was felt. Lady Gale had a sudden longing
for sleep, and her struggles against this entirely precluded
any attempt at keeping her guests pleasantly humoured.
Mrs. Maradick was never at her best after a meal, and now
all her former irritation returned with redoubled force. She
had been far too pleasant and affable to these people; she
could not think what had induced her to chatter and laugh
like that at lunch, she must be on her dignity. Mr. Lester’s
remark about her clothes and the gorse also rankled. What
impertinence! but there, these writing people always did
think that they could say anything to anybody! Novelist,
forsooth! everyone was a novelist nowadays. Mrs. Lawrence
didn’t make things any better by an interminable telling
of one of her inconclusive stories. Mrs. Maradick
bristled with irritation as she listened. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So there poor
Lady Parminter was, you know—dreadfully stout, and could
scarcely walk at all—with her black poodle and her maid
and no motor and raining cats and dogs. It was somewhere
near Sevenoaks, I think; or was it Canterbury? I think
perhaps it was Canterbury, because I know Mr. Pomfret
said something about a cathedral; although it might have
been Sevenoaks, because there was a number in it, and I
remember saying at the time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick stiffened with annoyance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lester gloomily faced the sea and Mrs. Lester chatted
rather hysterically to Lady Gale, who couldn’t hear what
she said because she was so sleepy. Mr. Lester hated
quarrelling, because it disturbed his work so; he knew that
there would be a reconciliation later, but one never knew
how long it would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was eventually Rupert who proposed the church. He
had found Mrs. Maradick very amusing at lunch, and he
thought a stroll with the little woman wouldn’t be bad fun.
So he interrupted Mrs. Lawrence’s story with “I say, there’s
a rotten old church somewhere kickin’ around. What d’you
say to runnin’ it to earth, what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone jumped up with alacrity. Mrs. Lester shook
her head. “I shall stay and keep guard over the tent,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Milly dear, you go,” said Lady Gale, “I’m much
too sleepy to move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I’ll stay to keep guard over you as well,”
said Mrs. Lester, laughing; “I’m lazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Rupert, Alice Du Cane, Mr. Lester, Mrs. Maradick
and Mrs. Lawrence started off. The expedition was a failure.
The church wasn’t found, and in the search for it
the tempers of all concerned were lost. It was terribly
hot, the sun beat down upon the gorse and there was very
little breeze. The gorse passed and they came to sand
dunes, and into these their feet sank heavily, their shoes
were clogged with it. Nobody spoke very much. It was
too hot and everybody had their own thoughts; Mrs. Lawrence
attempted to continue her story, but received no encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I vote we give up the church,” said Rupert, and they
all trudged drearily back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick was wondering why Mrs. Lester hadn’t
come with them. It didn’t make her wonder any the less
when, on their arrival at the tent, she saw Lady Gale and
Tony in sole possession. Where was the woman? Where
was her husband? She decided that Rupert Gale was a
nuisance. He had nothing to say that had any sense in it,
and as for Mr. Lester .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tea was therefore something of a spasmodic meal. Everybody
rushed furiously into conversation and then fled hurriedly
out again; an air of restraint and false geniality hung
over the teacups. Even Tony was quiet, and Lady Gale
felt, for once, that the matter was beyond her; everyone was
cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Lester and Maradick appeared and there was
a moment’s pause. They looked very cheerful and contented,
which made the rest of the party only the more irritable
and discontented. Why were they so happy? What right
had they to be so happy? They hadn’t got sand in their
shoes and a vague search after an impossible church under
a blazing sun in their tempers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester was anything but embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! there you all are! How nice you all look, and
I do hope you’ve left something! No, don’t bother to move,
Rupert. There’s plenty of room here! Here you are, Mr.
Maradick! Here’s a place; yes, we’ve had such a nice stroll,
Mr. Maradick and I. It was quite cool down by the beach.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thanks, dear, one lump and cream. Oh! don’t trouble,
Tony, I can reach it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, and did you see your church?
Oh! what a pity, and you had all that trouble for nothing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s going to be a storm!” said Mr. Lester gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little wind was sighing, up and down, over the gorse.
The sun shone as brilliantly as ever, but on the horizon
black, heavy clouds were gathering. Then suddenly the
little breeze fell and there was perfect stillness. The air
was heavy with the scent of the gorse. It was very hot.
Then, very faintly, the noise of thunder came across the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gods are angry,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! my dear!” said Lady Gale. “And there isn’t a
cover to the wagonette thing! Whatever shall we do? We
shall get soaked to the skin. I never dreamt of its raining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said Maradick, “if we started at once we
might get in before it broke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The things were hurriedly packed and everyone hastened
over the gorse. They clambered into the wagonette. Across
the sky great fleets of black clouds were hurrying and the
sound of the thunder was closer at hand. Everything was
still, with the immovability of something held by an invisible
hand, and the trees seemed to fling black pointing
fingers to the black gloomy sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a mile they raced the storm, and then it broke upon
them. The thunder crashed and the lightning flared across
their path, and then the rain came in sheeted floods. What
fun for the gods! They cowered back in their seats and
not a word was spoken by anyone; the driver lashed his
horses along the shining road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst they journeyed, each traveller was asking himself
or herself a question. These questions must be recorded,
because they will all be answered during the course of this
history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale’s question. Why did everything go wrong?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick’s question. Why had a malevolent providence
invented Mrs. Lester, and, having invented her, what
could James see in her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester’s question. At what hour that evening should
she have her reconciliation scene with her husband and for
how long could she manage to spin it out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Du Cane’s question. What was Tony keeping back?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s question. Was Janet afraid of thunder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick’s question. What did it all mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lester’s question. What was the use of being alive
at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert’s question. Why take a new suit to a picnic when
it always rained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lawrence’s question. Would the horses run away?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only question that received an immediate answer was
Mrs. Lawrence’s, because they didn’t.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, Maradick went for a moment to the room
of the minstrels. The storm was passing. On the horizon
there stole a very faint band of gold. Out of the black bank
of cloud a star shone, and suddenly there burst from the
dark shadows of the fleeing storm a silver crescent moon.
The light of it fell on the boards of the floor and then touched
faintly the grinning face of the carved lion.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>A LITTLE MUSIC</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch was in bed asleep, with the bedclothes drawn
up to his ears. It had just struck six, and round the
corner of the open window the sun crept, flinging a path of
light across the floor. Presently it would reach the bed and
strike Punch’s nose; Toby, awake and curled up on a mat
near the door, watched the light travel across the room and
waited for the inevitable moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was of the simplest. Against the wall leant the
Punch and Judy show, on the mantelpiece was a jar that
had once held plum jam and now contained an enormous
bundle of wild flowers. Two chairs, a bed, a chest of
drawers and a washstand completed the furniture. Against
the wall was pinned an enormous outline map of England.
This Punch had filled in himself, marking roads, inns,
houses, even trees; here and there the names of people were
written in a tiny hand. This map was his complete history
during the last twenty years; nothing of any importance
that had happened to him remained unchronicled. Sometimes
it would only be a cross or a line, but he remembered
what the sign stood for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun struck his nose and rested on his hair, and he
awoke. He said “Ugh” and “Ah” very loudly several
times, rubbed his eyes with his knuckles, raised his arms
above his head and yawned, and then sat up. His eyes
rested for a moment lovingly on the map. Parts of it were
coloured in chalk, red and yellow and blue, for reasons best
known to himself. The sight of it opened unending horizons:
sharp white roads curving up through the green and
brown into a blue misty distance, the round heaving shoulder
of some wind-swept down over which he had tramped as the
dusk was falling and the stars came slowly from their hiding-places
to watch him, the grey mists rising from some deep
valley as the sun rose red and angry—they stretched, those
roads and hills and valleys, beyond his room and the sea, for
ever and ever. And there were people too, in London, in
country towns, in lonely farms and tiny villages; the lines
and crosses on the map brought to his mind a thousand histories
in which he had played his part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Toby. “A swim, old man,” he said; “time
for a swim—out we get!” Toby unrolled himself, rubbed
his nose on his mat twice like an Eastern Mahommedan paying
his devotions, and strolled across to the bed. His morning
greeting to his master was always the same, he rolled
his eyes, licked his lips with satisfaction, and wagged an
ear; then he looked for a moment quite solemnly into his
master’s face with a gaze of the deepest devotion, then finally
he leapt upon the bed and curled up at his master’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch (whose real name, by the way, was David Garrick—I
don’t know why I didn’t say so before—he hadn’t the
slightest connexion with the actor, because his family didn’t
go back beyond his grandfather) stroked a paw and scratched
his head. “It’s time we got up and went for a swim, old
man. The sun’s been saying so hours ago.” He flung on
an overcoat and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cottage where he lived was almost on the beach.
Above it the town rose, a pile of red roofs and smoking
chimneys, a misty cloud of pale blue smoke twisted and
turned in the air. The world was full of delicious scents
that the later day destroyed, and everything behaved as
though it were seeing life for the first time; the blue smoke
had never discovered the sky before, the waves had never
discovered the sand before, the breeze had never discovered
the trees before. Very soon they would lose that surprise
and would find that they had done it all only yesterday, but,
at first, it was all quite new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch and Toby bathed; as they came out of the water
they saw Morelli sitting on a rock. Punch sat down on the
sand quite unconcernedly and watched the sea. He hadn’t
a towel, and so the sun must do instead. Toby, having
barked once, sat down too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Mr. Garrick,” said Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch looked up for a moment. “A fine day,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli came over to him. He was dressed in a suit of
some green stuff, so that against the background of green
boughs that fringed the farther side of the little cove he
seemed to disappear altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Mr. Garrick,” he said again. “A
splendid day for a bathe. I’d have gone in myself only I
know I should have repented it afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Punch. “You can bathe ’ere all the year
round. In point of fact, it’s ’otter at Christmas than it is
now. The sea takes a while to get warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This fine weather,” said Morelli, looking at the sea,
“brings a lot of people to the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Punch, “the ‘Man at Arms’ is full and all
the lodgings. It’s a good season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it makes some difference to you, Mr. Garrick,
whether there are people or no?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” said Punch, “if there’s no one ’ere I move.
I’m staying this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you find that the place changes?” said Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Punch, “it don’t alter at all. Now there are
places, Pendragon for one, that you wouldn’t know for the
difference. They’ve pulled down the Cove and built flats,
and there are niggers and what not. It’s better for the trade,
of course, but I don’t like the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, I remember Pendragon,” said Morelli. “There
was a house there, the Flutes—Trojan was the name of the
people—a fine place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ’e’s a nice man that’s there now,” said Punch,
“Sir ’Enry; what I call a man, but the place is rotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toby looked in his master’s face and knew that he was ill
at ease. He knew his master so well that he recognised
his sentiments about people without looking at him twice.
His own feelings about other dogs were equally well defined;
if he was suspicious of a dog he was on his guard, very
polite of course, but sniffing inwardly; his master did the
same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can remember when there were only two or three
houses in Pendragon,” said Morelli; then suddenly, “You
meet a great many people, Mr. Garrick. Everyone here
seems to know you. Do you happen to have met a young
fellow, Gale is his name? He is staying at the ‘Man at
Arms.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Punch. “I know Mr. Gale.” Why did
Morelli want to know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nice boy,” said Morelli. “I don’t often take to the
people who come here for the summer, they don’t interest me
as a rule. But this boy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off and watched Toby. He began to whistle
very softly, as though to himself. The dog pricked up his
ears, moved as though he would go to him, and then looked
up in his master’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another man,” continued Morelli, “that goes
about with young Gale. An older man, Maradick his name
is, I think. No relation, it seems, merely a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch said nothing. It was no business of his. Morelli
could find out what he wanted for himself. He got up.
“Well,” he said, wrapping his greatcoat about him, “I
must be going back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli came close to him and laid a hand on his arm.
“Mr. Garrick,” he said, “you dislike me. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch turned round and faced him. “I do, sir,” he said,
“that’s truth. I was comin’ down the high road from
Perrota one evenin’ whistling to myself, the dog was at my
heels. It was sunset and a broad red light over the sea.
I came upon you suddenly sitting by the road, but you didn’t
see me in the dust. You were laughing and in your hands
was a rabbit that you were strangling; it was dusk, but I
’eard the beast cry and I ’eard you laugh. I saw your
eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli smiled. “There are worse things than killing a
rabbit, Mr. Garrick,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the way you kill that counts,” said Punch, and he
went up the beach.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile there is Janet Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Minns was the very last person in the world fitted
to give anyone a settled education; in her early days she
had given young ladies lessons in French and music, but now
the passing of years had reduced the one to three or four
conversational terms and the other to some elementary tunes
about which there was a mechanical precision that was
anything but musical. Her lessons in deportment had, at
one time, been considered quite the thing, but now they had
grown a little out of date, and, like her music, lost freshness
through much repetition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her ideas of life were confined to the three or four families
with whom she had passed her days, and Janet had never
discovered anything of interest in any of her predecessors;
Alice Crate (her father was Canon Crate of Winchester
Cathedral), Mary Devonshire (her father was a merchant in
Liverpool), and Eleanor Simpson (her father was a stockbroker
and lived in London). Besides, all these things had
happened a long while ago; Miss Minns had been with Janet
for the last twelve years, and fact had become reminiscence
and reminiscence tradition within that time. Miss Minns
of the moment with which we have to do was not a very
lively person for a very young creature to be attached to;
she was always on the quiver, from the peak of her little
black bonnet to the tip of her tiny black shoes. When she
did talk, her conversation suffered from much repetition
and was thickly strewn with familiar proverbs, such as “All’s
well that ends well” and “Make hay while the sun shines.”
She served no purpose at all as far as Janet was concerned,
save as an occasional audience of a very negative kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only other person with whom Janet had been brought
into contact, her father, was far more perplexing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had accepted him in her early years as somebody about
whom there was no question. When he was amusing and
played with her there was no one in the world so completely
delightful. He had carried her sometimes into the
woods and they had spent the whole day there. She remembered
when he had whistled and sung and the animals had
come creeping from all over the wood. The birds had
climbed on to his shoulders and hands, rabbits and hares
had let him take them in his hands and had shown no fear
at all. She remembered once that a snake had crawled
about his arm. He had played with her as though he had
been a child like herself, and she had done what she pleased
with him and he had told her wonderful stories. And then
suddenly, for no reason that she could understand, that
mood had left him and he had been suddenly angry, terribly,
furiously angry. She had seen him once take a kitten that
they had had in his hands and, whilst it purred in his face,
he had twisted its neck and killed it. That had happened
when she was very small, but she would never forget it.
Then she had grown gradually accustomed to this rage and
had fled away and hidden. But on two occasions he had
beaten her, and then, afterwards, in a moment it had passed,
and he had cried and kissed her and given her presents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had known no other man, and so she could not tell
that they were not all like that. But, as the years had
passed, she had begun to wonder. She had asked Miss
Minns whether everybody could make animals come when
they whistled, and Miss Minns had admitted that the gift
was unusual, that, in fact, she didn’t know anyone else who
could do it. But Janet was growing old enough now to
realise that Miss Minns’ experience was limited and that she
did not know everything. She herself had tried to attract
the birds, but they had never come to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father’s fury had seemed to her like the wind or rain;
something that came to him suddenly, blowing from no certain
place, and something, too, for which he was not responsible.
She learnt to know that they only lasted a short
time, and she used to hide herself until they were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all this she did not love him. He gave her very little
opportunity of doing so. His affection was as strangely
fierce as his temper and frightened her almost as badly. She
felt that that too was outside himself, that he had no love
for her personally, but felt as he did about the animals,
about anything young and wild. It was this last characteristic
that was strangest of all to her. It was very difficult
to put it into words, but she had seen that nothing made him
so furious as the conventional people of the town. She was
too young to recognise what it was about them that made
him so angry, but she had seen him grow pale with rage at
some insignificant thing that some one had said or done. On
the other hand, he liked the wildest people of the place, the
fishermen and tramps that haunted the lower quarters of
the town. All this she grasped very vaguely, because she
had no standard of comparison; she knew no one else. But
fear had made love impossible; she was frightened when he
was fond of her, she was frightened when he was angry with
her. Miss Minns, too, was a difficult person to bestow love
upon. She did not want it, and indeed resolutely flung it
back with the remark that emotion was bad for growing girls
and interfered with their education. When she lived at all
she lived in the past, and Janet was only a very dim shadowy
reflexion of the Misses Crate, Devonshire, and Simpson, who
had glorified her earlier years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet, therefore, had spent a very lonely and isolated childhood,
and, as she had grown, the affection that was in her had
grown too, and she had had no one to whom she might give
it. At first it had been dolls, and ugly and misshapen though
they were they had satisfied her. But the time came when
their silence and immobility maddened her, she wanted something
that would reply to her caresses and would share with
her all her thoughts and ideas. Then Miss Minns came,
and Janet devoted herself to her with an ardour that was
quite new to the good lady; but Miss Minns distrusted enthusiasm
and had learnt, whilst educating Miss Simpson, to
repress all emotion, so she gave it all back to Janet again,
carefully wrapped up in tissue paper. When Janet found
that Miss Minns didn’t want her, and that she was only using
her as a means of livelihood, she devoted herself to animals,
and in a puppy, a canary and a black kitten she found what
she wanted. But then came the terrible day when her father
killed the kitten, and she determined never to have another
pet of any kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time she was about fifteen and she had read
scarcely anything. Her father never talked to her about
books, and Miss Minns considered most novels improper and
confined herself to Mrs. Hemans and the “Fairchild Family.”
Janet’s ideas of the world were, at this time, peculiar.
Her father had talked to her sometimes strangely about places
that he had seen, but they had never attracted her: mountain
heights, vast unending seas, tangled forests, sun-scorched
deserts; always things without people, silent, cold, relentless.
She had asked him about cities and he had spoken
sometimes about London, and this had thrilled her through
and through. What she longed for was people; people all
round her, friends who would love her, people whom she
herself could help. And then suddenly, on an old bookshelf
that had remained untouched for many years past, she had
found “Kenilworth.” There was a picture that attracted
her and she had begun to read, and then a new world opened
before her. There were several on the shelf: Lytton’s
“Rienzi” and “The Last of the Barons,” George Eliot’s
“Middlemarch,” Trollope’s “Barchester Towers,” and Miss
Braddon’s “Lady Audley’s Secret.” There were some other
things; somebody’s “History of England,” a Geography of
Europe, a torn volume of Shakespeare, and the “Pickwick
Papers.” Living, hitherto a drab and unsatisfactory affair,
became a romantic thrilling business in which anything might
happen, a tremendous bran pie into which one was continually
plunging for plums. She had no doubt at all that there
would be adventures for her in the future. Everyone, even
the people in “Middlemarch,” had adventures, and it was
absurd to suppose that she wouldn’t have them as well.
She noticed, too, that all the adventures that these people
had rose from the same source, namely love. She did not
realise very thoroughly what this love was, except that it
meant finding somebody for whom you cared more than
anyone else in the world and staying with them for the
rest of your life, and perhaps after. She did not admire
all the people of whom the heroines were enamoured, but
she realised that everyone thought differently about such
things, and that there was apt to be trouble when two ladies
cared for the same gentleman or <span class='it'>vice versa</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only you must, so to speak, have your chance, and that
she seemed to be missing. It was all very well to watch
romance from your high window and speculate on its possibilities
as it passed down the street, but you ought to be
down in the midst of it if you were going to do anything. It
all seemed ridiculously simple and easy, and she waited for
her knight to come with a quiet and assured certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first she had attacked Miss Minns on the question,
but had got little response. Miss Minns was of the opinion
that knights were absurd, and that it did not do to expect
anything in this world, and that in any case young girls
oughtn’t to think about such things, and that it came of
reading romances and stuff, with a final concession that it
was “Love that made the world go round,” and that “It
was better to have loved and lost than never to have loved
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was to little purpose, but it was of trivial importance,
because Janet was quite settled in her mind about the
whole affair. She had no ideal knight; he was quite vague,
hidden in a cloud of glory, and she did not want to see his
face; but that he would come she was sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, afterwards, she gave her knight kingdoms and palaces
and a beautiful life in which she had some vague share, as
of a worshipper before a misty shrine. And he, indeed, was
long in coming. She met no one from one year’s end to another,
and wistful gazing from her window was of no use at
all. She wished that she had other girls for company. She
saw them pass, sometimes, through the town, arm in arm;
fisher-girls, perhaps, or even ladies from the hotel, and she
longed, with an aching longing, to join them and tell them
all that she was thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father never seemed to consider that she might be
lonely. He never thought very much about her at all, and
he was not on sufficiently good terms with the people of the
place to ask them to his home; he would not have known
what to do with them if he had had them there, and would
have probably played practical jokes, to their extreme discomfiture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Tony came. She did not see him with any
surprise. She had known that it was only a matter of
waiting, and she had no doubt at all that he was the knight
in question. Her ignorance of the world prevented her from
realising that there were a great many other young men
dressed in the same way and with the same charming manners.
From the first moment that she saw him she took it
for granted that they would marry and would go away to
some beautiful country, where they would live in the sunshine
for ever. And with it all she was, in a way, practical.
She knew that it would have to be a secret, that Miss Minns
and her father must know nothing about it, and that there
would have to be plots and, perhaps, an escape. That was
all part of the game, and if there were no difficulties there
would be no fun. She had no scruples about the morality
of escaping from Miss Minns and her father. They neither
of them loved her, or if they did, they had not succeeded
in making her love them, and she did not think they would
miss her very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was also very thankful to Providence for having sent
her so charming a knight. She loved every bit of him, from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, his curly hair,
his eyes, his smile, his mouth, his hands. Oh! he would fit
into her background very handsomely. And charming
though he was, it never entered her head for a moment that
he was not in love with her. Of course he was! She had
seen it in his eyes from the very first minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so all the scruples, the maidenly modesty and the
bashful surprise that surround the love affairs of most of
her sex were entirely absent. It seemed to her like the
singing of a lark in the sky or the murmur of waves across
the sand; something inevitable and perfectly, easily natural.
There might be difficulties and troubles, because there were
people like Miss Minns in the world, but they would pass
away in time, and it would be as though they had never
existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only thing that puzzled her a little was Maradick.
She did not understand what he was doing there. Was
he always coming whenever Tony came? He was old like
her father, but she thought he looked pleasant. Certainly
not a person to be afraid of, and perhaps even some one
to whom one could tell things. She liked his size and his
smile and his quiet way of talking. But still it was a
nuisance his being there at all. There were quite enough
complications already with Miss Minns and father without
another elderly person. And why was Tony with him at
all? He was an old man, one of those dull, elderly people
who might be nice and kind but couldn’t possibly be any
use as a friend. She tried to get Miss Minns to solve the
problem, but that lady murmured something about “Birds
of a feather,” and that it was always proper to pay calls in
twos, which was no use at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Janet gave up Maradick for the present with a sigh
and a shake of the head. But she was most blissfully happy.
That country that had remained so long without an inhabiter
was solitary no longer, her dreams and pictures
moved before her now with life and splendour. She went
about her day with a light in her eyes, humming a little song,
tender and sympathetic with Miss Minns because she, poor
thing, could not know how glorious a thing it was, this
love!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know whether Miss Minns had her suspicions.
She must have noticed Janet’s pleasant temper and gaiety,
but she said nothing. As to Morelli, there was no telling
what he noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to the house after his conversation with
Punch in no pleasant humour. Janet had been up since a
very early hour; she never could sleep when the sun was
bright, and she was very happy. She had a suspicion that
Tony would come to-day. It was based on nothing very
certain, but she had dreamt that he would; and it was the
right kind of day for him to come on, when the sun was so
bright and a butterfly had swept through the window like
the petal of a white rose blown by the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she met her father with a laugh when he came in
and led the way gaily to breakfast. But in a moment she
saw that something was wrong, and, at the thought that one
of his rages was sweeping over him and that she would not be
able to escape, her face grew very white and her lips began
to tremble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew the symptoms of it. He sat very quietly with
his hands crumbling the bread at his side; he was frowning,
but very slightly, and he spoke pleasantly about ordinary
things. As a rule when he was like this she crept away up
to her room and locked her door, but now there seemed no
chance of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she talked gaily and laughed, although her heart
was beating so loudly that she thought that he would hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Minns and I are going to walk over to Tregotha
Point this afternoon, father,” she said; “there are flowers
there and we shall take books. Only I shall be back for tea,
and so we shall start early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said nothing, but looked at the tablecloth. She looked
round the room as though for a means of escape. It was all
so cheerful that it seemed to mock her, the red-tiled fireplace,
the golden globe of the lamp, the shining strip of blue sky
beyond the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tea, father?” The teapot trembled a little in her hand.
She could not talk; when the storm was approaching some
actual presence seemed to come from the clouds and place an
iron grip upon her. It had been some while since the last
time and she had begun to hope that it might not happen
again, and now——She was afraid to speak lest her voice
should shake. The smile on her lips froze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, looking at her across the table, “talk
to me.” The look that she knew so well came into his face;
there was a little smile at the corners of his mouth and his
eyes stared straight in front of him as though he were looking
past her into infinite distances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said again, “why don’t you talk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—have nothing to say,” she stammered, “we haven’t
done anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly the storm broke. He gave a little
scream like a wild animal, and, with one push of the hand,
the table went over, crashing to the ground. The crockery
lay in shattered pieces on the blue carpet. Janet crouched
back against the wall, but he came slowly round the table
towards her. His back was bent a little and his head
stretched forward like an animal about to spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was crying bitterly, with her hands pressed in front
of her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, father,” she said, “I haven’t done anything—I
didn’t know—I haven’t done anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said it again and again between her tears. Morelli
came over to her. “There was a man,” he said between
his teeth, “a man whom I saw this morning, and he said
things. Oh! if I had him here!” He laughed. “I would
kill him, here, with my hands. But you see, you shall never
speak to him again, you don’t go near him.” He spoke with
passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer. He shook her shoulder. “Well,
speak, can’t you?” He took her arm and twisted it, and
then, apparently maddened by her immobility and her tears,
he struck her with his hand across the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let her sink to the floor in a heap, then for a moment
he looked down on her. There was absolute silence in the
room, a shaft of light fell through the window, caught a
gleaming broken saucer on the floor, lighted the red tiles
and sparkled against the farther wall. Janet was sobbing
very quietly, crouching on the floor with her head in her
hands. He looked at her for a moment and then crept
silently from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stillness and peace and the twittering of a bird at the
window brought her to her senses. It had happened so often
before that it did not take her long to recover. She got up
from her knees and wiped her eyes; she pushed back her
hair and put the pins in carefully. Then she felt her cheek
where he had struck her. It always happened like that,
suddenly, for no reason at all. She knew that it was due
to no bitter feeling against herself. Anything that came
in his way at the time would suffer, as Miss Minns had learnt.
Doubtless she was up in her room now with her door locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this occasion was different from all the others. When
it had happened before, quite the worst part of it had been
the loneliness. It had seemed such a terribly desolate world,
and she had seen infinite, dreary years stretching before her
in which she remained, defenceless and without a friend, at
the mercy of his temper. But now that her knight had come
she did not mind at all. It would not be long before she
escaped altogether, and, in any case, he was there to be sorry
for her and comfort her. She would, of course, tell him all
about it, because she would tell him everything. She felt no
anger against her father. He was like that; she knew what
it felt like to be angry, she had screamed and stamped and bit
when she was a little girl in just that kind of way. She
was rather sorry for him, because she knew he was always
sorry afterwards. And then it was such a relief that it was
over. The worst part of it was that sickening terror at
first, when she did not know what he might do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She set up the table again, collected the pieces of crockery
from the floor and carried them into the kitchen. She then
wiped up the pool of tea that had dripped on to the carpet.
After this she realised that she was hungry, that she had
had nothing at all, and she sat down and made a picnicky
meal. By the end of it she was humming to herself as
though nothing had occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, she took her work and sat in the window. Her
thoughts, as indeed was always the case now, were with
Tony. She made up stories for him, imagined what he was
doing at the moment and what the people were like to whom
he was talking. She still felt sure that he would come and
see them that afternoon. Then the door opened, and she
knew that her father had returned. She did not turn round,
but sat with her back to the door, facing the window. She
could see a corner of the street with its shining cobbles, a
dark clump of houses, a strip of the sky. The noise of the
market came distantly up to her, and some cart rattled round
the corner very, very faintly; the sound of the mining-stamp
swung like a hammer through the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard him step across the room and stand waiting
behind her. She was not afraid of him now; she knew
that he had come back to apologise. She hated that as much
as the rage, it seemed to hurt just as badly. She bent her
head a little lower over her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet,” he spoke imploringly behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father!” She turned and smiled up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent down and kissed her. “Janet! dear, I’m so
sorry. I really can’t think why I was angry. You know
I do get impatient sometimes, and that man had made me
angry by the things he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood away from her with his head hanging like a
child who was waiting to be punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, father, please don’t.” She stood up and looked
at him. “You know it is very naughty of you, and after
you promised so faithfully last time that you wouldn’t get
angry like that again. It’s no use promising if you never
keep it, you know. And then think of all the china you’ve
broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know.” He shook his head dolefully. “I don’t
know what it is, my dear. I never seem to get any better.
And I don’t mean anything, you know. I really don’t mean
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she doubted that a little as she looked at him. She
knew that, although his rage might pass, he did not forget.
She had known him cherish things in his head long after
they had passed from the other man’s memory, and she had
seen him take his revenge. Who was this man who had insulted
him? A sudden fear seized her. Supposing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” she said, looking up at him, “who was it said
things to you this morning that made you angry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, never mind that now, dear,” he said, his lip curling
a little. “We will forget. See, I am sorry; you have forgiven
me?” He sat down and drew her to him. “Look!
I am just like a child. I am angry, and then suddenly it all
goes.” He stroked her hair with his hand, and bent and
kissed her neck. “Where was it that I hit her? Poor
darling! There, on the cheek? Poor little cheek! But
look! Hit me now hard with your fist. Here on the cheek.
I am a brute, a beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, father,” she laughed and pulled herself away from
him, “It is nothing! I have forgotten it already. Only,
dear me! all the broken china! Such expense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear, never mind the expense. I have a plan,
and we will have a lovely day. We will go into the wood
with our lunch and will watch the sea, and I will tell you
stories, and will play to you. What! now, won’t that be
good fun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His little yellow face was wreathed in smiles; he hummed
a little tune and his feet danced on the floor. He passed
his hand through his hair so that it all stood on end. “We’ll
have such a game,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled. “Yes, father dear, that will be lovely. Only,
we will be back this afternoon, because perhaps——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I know!” He laughed at her. “Callers! Why,
yes, of course. We shall be here if they come.” He chuckled
to himself. “I am afraid, my dear, you have been lonely
all these years. I ought to have thought of it, to give you
companions.” Then he added after a little pause, “But he
is a nice young fellow, Mr. Gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a little sigh of relief; then it was not he who
had quarrelled with her father that morning. “That will
be splendid. I’ll go and get lunch at once.” She bent down
and kissed him, and then went singing out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could, when he liked, be perfectly delightful, and
he was going to like that afternoon, she knew. He was the
best fun in the world. Poor thing! He would be hungry!
He had no breakfast. And he sat in front of the window,
smiling and humming a little tune to himself. The sun
wrapped his body round with its heat, all the live things
in the world were calling to him. He saw in front of him
endless stretches of country, alive, shining in the sun. He
stared in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was market-day, and the market-place was crowded.
Janet loved it, and her cheeks were flushed as she passed
through the line of booths. As they crossed in front of
the tower she saw that some one was leaning over the stall
talking to the old fruit woman. Her heart began to beat
furiously; he was wearing no cap, and she heard his laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned round suddenly as though he knew who it was.
The light suddenly flamed in his eyes, and he came forward:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Mr. Morelli,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the crowded market-place she was the only thing
that he saw. She was dressed in a white muslin with red
roses on it, and over her arm was slung the basket with the
lunch; her hair escaped in little golden curls from under
her broad hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she found that she didn’t know what to say. This
was a great surprise to her, because when she had thought
about him in her room, alone, she had always had a great
deal to say, and a great many questions to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now she stood in the sun and hung her head. Morelli
watched them both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stammered. “Good-morning, Miss Morelli. I—I
can’t take off my cap because I haven’t got one. Isn’t it a
ripping day?” He held out his hand and she took it, and
then they both laughed. The old woman behind them in
her red peaked hat screamed, “A-pples and O-ranges! Fine
ripe grapes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going out for a picnic, father and I,” said Janet
at last. “We’ve got lunch in this basket. It’s a day that
you can’t be in doors, simply!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I know,” he looked hungrily at the basket, as
though he would have loved to have proposed coming as
well. “Yes, it’s a great day.” Then he looked at her and
started. She had been crying. She was smiling and laughing,
but he could see that she had been crying. The mere
thought of it made his blood boil; who had made her cry?
He looked quickly at Morelli; was it he? Perhaps it was
Miss Minns? or perhaps she wasn’t well, but he must know
if she were unhappy; he would find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of coming to call this afternoon, Mr.
Morelli,” he said, “Maradick and I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but if you are
going to spend the day in the woods, another day——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said Morelli, smiling, “we shall be back again
by four. We are only going to have lunch. We should be
delighted to see you, and your friend.” Then they said
good-bye, and Tony watched them as they turned out of the
market-place. They didn’t talk very much as they passed
through the town, they had, each of them, their own thoughts.
Janet was very happy; he was coming to tea, and they would
be able to talk. But how silly she was, she could suddenly
think of a hundred things that she would like to have said to
him. They turned off the hard white road that ran above
the sea and passed along a narrow lane. It was deeply rutted
with cart-tracks, and the trees hung so thickly over it that it
was quite dark. It wound up the sides of a green hill and
then dived suddenly into the heart of a wood. Here there
were pine trees, and a broad avenue over which they passed
crushing the needles under their feet. The trees met in a
green tapestry of colours above their heads, and through it
the sun twinkled in golden stars and broad splashes of light.
The avenue dwindled into a narrow path, and then suddenly
it ended in a round green knoll humped like the back of a
camel. The grass was a soft velvety green, and the trees
stood like sentinels on every side, but in front they parted
and there was a wonderful view. The knoll was at the top
of the hill, and you could see straight down, above and beyond
the trees of the wood, the sea. To the right there was another
clearing, and a little cove of white sand and brown
rocks shone in the sun. There was perfect stillness, save for
a little breeze that rocked the trees so that they stirred like
the breathing of some sleeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet and her father always came to this place. Afterwards
she was to see a great many cities and countries, but
this green wood always remained to her the most perfect
thing in the world. It was so still that you could, if you
held your breath, hear the tiny whisper of the waves across
the shingle and the murmur of the mining stamp. It was
a wonderful place for whispers; the trees, the sea, the birds,
even the flowers seemed to tell secrets, and Janet used to
fancy that if she lay there, silently, long enough, she would,
like the man in the fairy tale, hear what they were saying.
She noticed that she always seemed to hear more when she was
with her father. She had gone there sometimes with Miss
Minns, and had wondered how she could be so fanciful.
Nothing had whispered at all, and Miss Minns had had a
headache. But to-day everything seemed to have a new
meaning; her meeting with Tony had lent it a colour, an
intensity that it had not had before. It was as though they
all—the sea, the sky, the trees, the animals—knew that she
had got a knight and would like to tell her how glad they
were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli sat perched on the highest peak of the knoll with
his legs crossed beneath him. He was at his very best; gay,
laughing, throwing the pine needles like a child into the
air, singing a little song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, my dear, and talk to me.” He made way
for her beside him. “Everything is singing to-day. There
is a bird in a tree above us who has just told me how happy
he is. I hope you are happy, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, father, very.” She gave a little sigh of satisfaction
and lay back on the grass at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t be ashamed of showing it. Have your feelings
and show them. Never mind what they are, but don’t
cover them as though you were afraid that they would catch
cold. Don’t mind feeling intensely, hurting intensely, loving
intensely. It is a world of emotion, not of sham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She never paid any very deep attention when he talked
about rules of life. Existence seemed to her, at present,
such an easy affair that rules weren’t necessary; people
made such a bother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay back and stared straight into the heart of the
sky. Two little clouds, like pillows, bulged against the blue;
the hard sharp line of the pines cut into space, and they
moved together slowly like the soft opening and closing of a
fan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew a place once like this,” said Morelli. “It was
in Greece. A green hill overlooking the sea, and on it a
white statue; they came to worship their god there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this talk of God?” she asked him, resting on
one elbow and looking up at him. “You have never told
me, father, but of course I have read and have heard people
talk. Who is God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked it with only a very languid interest. She
had never speculated at all about the future. The world was
so wonderful, and there were such a number of things all
around her to think about, that discussion about something
that would affect her at the end of her life, when all the
world was dark and she was old and helpless, seemed absurd.
She would want the end to come then, when she was deaf
and blind and cold; she would not spoil the young colour and
intensity of her life by thinking about it. But with the
sudden entrance of Tony the question came forward again.
They would not live for ever; life seemed very long to her,
but the time must come when they would die. And then?
Who was this God? Would He see to it that she and Tony
were together afterwards? If so, she would worship Him;
she would bring Him flowers, and light candles as Miss
Minns did. As she sat there and heard the woods and the
sea she thought that the answer must be somewhere in them.
He must have made this colour and sound, and, if that were
so, He could not be unkind. She watched the two clouds;
they had swollen into the shape of bowls, their colour was
pale cream, and the sun struck their outer edges into a very
faint gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is God?” she said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli looked at her. “There were gods once,” he said.
“People were faithful in those days, and they saw clearly.
Now the world is gloomy, because of the sin that it thinks
that it has committed, or because pleasure has been acid to the
taste. Then they came with their songs and flowers to the
hill, and, with the sky at their head and the sea at their
feet, they praised the God whom they knew. Now——”
He stared fiercely in front of him. “Oh! these people!”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not ask him any more. She could not understand
what he had said, and she was afraid lest her questions
should bring his fury back again. But the question was
there; many new questions were there, and she was to spend
her life in answering them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they had lunch whilst the two clouds divided into three
and danced with white trailing garments across the sun;
then again they were swans, and vanished with their necks
proudly curved into space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” said Janet, with an abstracted air, as though
she was thinking of some one else, “Do you think Mr. Gale
handsome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear,” he answered. “He’s young, very young,
and that is worth all the looks in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he is very handsome,” she said, staring in front
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, I know you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like him, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.” Morelli smiled. “I like to see you together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mr. Maradick, father? What do you think of
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mr. Maradick!” Morelli laughed. “He is going
to have a bad time; life comes late to some people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I like him,” said Janet, thoughtfully, “I know
he’s kind, but he’s old; he’s older than you are, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be younger before he’s left Treliss,” said Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After lunch he took his flute from his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay motionless, with her arms behind her head; she
became part of the landscape; her white dress lay about her
like a cloud, her hair spread like sunlight over the grass,
and her eyes stared, shining, into the sky. He sat, with his
legs crossed under him, on the swelling grass, and stared at
the tops of the trees and the sweep of the sea. No part of
him moved except his fingers, which twinkled on the flute;
the tune was a little gay dance that sparkled in the air and
seemed to set all the trees in motion, even the three little
clouds came back again and lay like monstrous white birds
against the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two figures were absorbed into the surrounding country.
His brown face and sharp nose seemed to belong to
the ground on which he sat; the roses on her dress seemed
to grow about her, and her hair lay around her like daffodils
and primroses. The gay tune danced along, and the sun
rose high above their heads; a mist rose from the sea like a
veil and, shot with colour, blue and green, enveloped the
woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there were stealthy movements about the two figures.
Birds, thrushes, chaffinches, sparrows, hopped across
the grass. A pigeon cooed softly above his head; two rabbits
peeped out from the undergrowth. They grew bolder,
and a sparrow, its head on one side, hopped on to Janet’s
dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More rabbits came, and the pigeon, with a soft whirr
of its wings, swept down to Morelli’s feet. The grass was
soon dotted with birds, a squirrel ran down a tree-trunk and
stayed, with its tail in the air, to listen. The birds grew
bolder and hopped on to Morelli’s knee; a sparrow stood for
a moment on Morelli’s head and then flew away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet showed no astonishment at these things. She had
often seen her father play to the animals before, and they
had come. Suddenly he piped a shrill, discordant note, and
with a whirr of their wings the birds had vanished and the
rabbits disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his flute into his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nearly four o’clock,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” she said as they went down the hill, “can other
people do that? Make the birds and animals come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? What is it that you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing that I do,” he said. “It’s what I am.
Don’t you worry your head about that, my dear. Only
don’t say that anything’s impossible. ‘There’s more in
Heaven and earth than is dreamed of in the philosophy’ of
those folks who think that they know such a lot. Don’t
ever disbelieve anything, my dear. Everything’s true, and
a great deal more as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Tony dragged a reluctant Maradick to tea.
“They don’t want me,” he said, “you’ll be making me hideously
unpopular, Tony, if you keep dragging me there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told them you were coming,” said Tony resolutely.
“And of course you are. There are simply heaps of reasons.
The plot’s thickening like anything, and it’s absurd
of you to pretend that you are not in it, because you are,
right up to your neck. And now I’ll give you my reasons.
In the first place there’s mother. At the picnic yesterday
Alice spotted that there was some one else; of course she will
speak to mother, probably has spoken already. As I have
told you already, she has perfect confidence in you, and as
long as you are there it’s perfectly right, but if you leave
me she’ll begin to worry her head off. Then again, there’s
Janet herself. I want her to get to know you and trust
you. She’ll want some one older just as much as I do,
probably more, because she’s a girl and a frightful kid.
Oh! rot! I’m no use at explaining, and the situation’s jolly
difficult; only how can she possibly trust you and the rest
of it, if she never sees you? And last of all, there’s me.
I want you to see how the thing’s going so that we can talk
about it. There’s something ‘up,’ I know, I could see this
morning that she’d been crying. I believe Morelli’s beastly
to her or something. Anyhow, you’re bound and pledged and
everything, and you’re a ripping old brick to be so decent
about it,” at the end of which Tony, breathless with argument
and excitement seized Maradick by the arm and dragged
him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick had a great deal to think about, and it was
as much for this reason as for any real reluctance to visit
the Morellis that he hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the tea-party was a great success. Everyone was in
the very best of humours, and the restraint that had been
there a little on the first occasion had now quite passed away.
The sun poured into the room, and shone so that everything
burnt with colour. Maradick felt again how perfect
a setting it made for the two who were its centre, the blue-tiled
fireplace, the fantastic blue and white china on the
walls, the deep blue of the carpet set the right note for a
background. On the table the tea-things, the old silver teapot
and milk jug, old red and white plates and an enormous
bowl of flaming poppies, gave the colour. Then against the
blue sky and dark brown roofs beyond the window was Janet,
with her golden hair and the white dress with the pink roses.
Miss Minns was the only dark figure in the room and she
scarcely seemed to matter. The only words that she spoke
were to Maradick, “In for a penny in for a pound,” she
suddenly flung at him à propos of some story of Epsom
expenses, and then felt apparently that she had said too much
and was quiet for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli was at his pleasantest, and showed how agreeable
a companion he could be. Maradick still felt the same distrust
of him, but he was forced to confess that he had never
before met anyone so entertaining. His knowledge of other
countries seemed inexhaustible; he had been everywhere, and
had a way of describing things and places that brought them
straight with him into the room, so vivid were they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His philosophy of life in general appeared, this afternoon
pleasant and genial. He spoke of men who had failed with
commiseration and a very wide charity; he seemed to extend
his affection to everyone, and said with a smile that “It
was only a question of knowing people; they were all good
fellows at heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, through it all, Maradick felt as though he were,
in some unexplained way, playing at a game. The man
was rather like a child playing at being grown-up and talking
as he had heard his elders do. He had an impulse to say,
“Look here, Morelli, it’s boring you dreadfully talking like
this, you’re not a bit interested, really and truly, and we’re
only playing this game as a background for the other two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in fact, that was what it all came to; that was
Maradick’s immediate problem that must be answered before
any of the others. What was Morelli’s idea about his
daughter and Tony? Morelli knew, of course, perfectly
well what was going on. You could see it in their eyes.
And, apparently, as far as Maradick could see, he liked it
and wanted it to continue. Why? Did he want them to
marry? No, Maradick didn’t think that he did. He
watched them with a curious smile; what was it that he
wanted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they, meanwhile, the incredible pair with their incredible
youth, were silent. It was through no constraint,
but rather, perhaps, because of their overflowing happiness.
Tony smiled broadly at the whole world, and every now and
again his eyes fastened on her face with a look of assured
possession, in the glance with which she had greeted him he
had seen all that he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned round to him. “Oh, Mr. Gale, you
haven’t seen the garden, our garden. You really must. It’s
small, but it’s sweet. You will come, Mr. Maradick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father looked up at her with a smile. “You take
Mr. Gale, dear. We’ll follow in a moment.” And so they
went out together. He thought that he had never seen so
sweet a place. The high walls were old red brick, the lawn
stretched the whole length, and around it ran a brown
gravelled path. In one corner was an enormous mulberry
leaning heavily to one side, and supported by old wooden
stakes and held together by bands of metal. Immediately
beneath the wall, and around the length of the garden, was
a flower bed filled with pansies and hollyhocks and nasturtiums;
it was a blaze of colour against the old red of the
wall and behind the green of the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Underneath the mulberry tree was a seat, and they sat
down close enough to make Tony’s heart beat very hard indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s perfect!” he said with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s very lovely, isn’t it? I’ve never known any
other garden, and now you don’t know how nice it is to have
some one to show it to. I’ve never had anyone to show it
to before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old house looked lovely from the garden. Its walls
bulged towards them in curious curves and angles, it seemed
to hang over the lawn like a protecting deity. The light of
the sun caught its windows and they flamed red and gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like having me to show it to?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both suddenly uncomfortable. Everything
around and about them seemed charged with intensest meaning.
They began, each of them, to be more uncertain about
the other. Perhaps after all they had read the signs wrongly.
Janet suddenly reflected that she had known no other young
men, and, after all, they might all have that habit of smiling
and looking pleasant. It might be merely politeness, and
probably meant nothing at all. She had been much too
hasty; she took a stolen glance at him and fancied that he
looked as though he were a little bored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s much nicer,” she said a little coldly, “in the summer
than the winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her for a moment, and then burst out laughing.
“I say,” he said, “don’t let’s start being polite to
each other, we’re friends. You know we made a compact the
other day. We’ve got such a lot to talk about that we
mustn’t waste time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I’m so glad,” she sighed with relief; “you see I
know so few people that I didn’t a bit know whether I was
doing the right sort of thing. You looked a very little bit
as though you were bored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” he said. “I should think not. Do you
know, it’s the rippingest thing in the world coming and
talking to you, and I’d been wondering ever since last time
how soon it would be before I could come and talk to you
again. And now, if you like my coming, it’s simply
splendid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, please come often,” she said, smiling. “I haven’t
got many friends, and we seem to think the same about such
lots of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I love this place and this garden and everything,
and I expect that I shall come often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I think you’re wonderful!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please don’t.” He bent towards her and touched
her hand. “That’s only because you haven’t seen other
people much. I’m most awfully ordinary, quite a commonplace
sort of chap. I’d be awfully sick with myself really
if I had time to think about it, but there’s such a lot going
on that one simply can’t bother. But you’ll do me a lot of
good if you’ll let me come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I!</span>” She opened her eyes wide. “How funny you are!
I’m no use to anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re both most fearfully modest,” he said, smiling,
“and when people say how rotten they are they generally
mean just the opposite. But I don’t, really. I mean it
absolutely.” Then he lowered his voice. “We’re friends,
aren’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, very softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand took hers very gently. At the touch of her
fingers his heart began suddenly to pound his breast so that
he could not hear, a quiver shook his body, he bent his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m an awfully poor sort of fellow,” he said in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mulberry tree, the lawn, the shining windows, the
flowers caught the tone and for one moment fell like a burning
cloud about the two, then the light died away.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the green wood, on the knoll, a little breeze played
with the tops of the trees; down, far below, the white beach
shone in the sun and the waves curled in dancing rows across
the blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two rabbits fancied for a moment that they heard the tune
that had charmed them earlier in the day. They crept out
to look, but there was no one on the knoll.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>IN WHICH EVERYONE FEELS THE AFTER EFFECT OF</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>THE PICNIC</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the picnic remained, for others besides
Maradick, an interpretation. Lady Gale sat on the
evening of the following day watching the sun sink behind
the silver birch. She had dressed for dinner earlier than
usual, and now it was a quarter to eight and she was still
alone in the gradually darkening room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester came in. She was dressed in pale blue, and
she moved with that sure confidence that a woman always
has when she knows that she is dressed with perfect correctness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” she said, bending down and kissing Lady
Gale, “I’m perfectly lovely to-night, and it isn’t the least
use telling me that it’s only vanity, because I know perfectly
well I’m the real right thing, as Henry James would
say if he saw me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see, dear,” said Lady Gale, “but from the
glimpse I’ve got I like the dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s perfection! The only thing is that it seems
such a waste down here! There’s no one who cares in the
least whether you’re a fright or no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s at any rate, Fred,” said Lady Gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Fred!” said Mrs. Lester scornfully. “He would
never see if you stuck it right under his nose. He can dress
his people in his novels, but he never has the remotest notion
what his wife’s got on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows more than you think,” said Lady Gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know Fred pretty well; besides,” Mrs. Lester
added, smiling a little, “he doesn’t deserve to have anything
done for him just now. He’s been very cross and nasty
these few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting on a stool at Lady Gale’s feet with her
hands clasped round her knees, her head was flung back and
her eyes shining; she looked rather like a cross, peevish child
who had been refused something that it wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale sighed for a moment and looked out into the
twilight; in the dark blue of the sky two stars sparkled.
“Take care of it, dear,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what?” said Mrs. Lester, looking up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love, when you’ve got it.” Lady Gale put her hand
out and touched Mrs. Lester’s arm. “You know perfectly
well that you’ve got Fred’s. Don’t play with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fred cares about his books,” Mrs. Lester said slowly.
“I don’t think that he cares the very least about me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you know that’s untrue. You’re cross just now
and so is he, and both of you imagine things. But down in
your hearts you are absolutely sure of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid that I may be tiresome,” said Lady Gale
gently, “but, my dear, I’ve lived such a long time and I
know that it’s sufficiently rare to get the right man. You’ve
got him, and you’re so certain that he’s right that you think
that you can play with it, and it’s dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a bit certain,” said Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are, of course you are. You know that Fred’s
devoted to you and you’re devoted to Fred. Only it’s rather
dull that everything should go along so soberly and steadily,
and you think that you’ll have some fun by quarrelling
and worrying him. You’re piqued sometimes because you
don’t think that he pays you enough attention and you imagine
that other men will pay you more, and he is very patient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you don’t know how annoying he can be sometimes,”
said Mrs. Lester, shaking her head. “When he
shuts himself up in his stupid books and isn’t aware that I’m
there at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I know,” said Lady Gale. “All men are annoying
and so are all women. Anyone that we’ve got to live
with is bound to be; that’s the whole point of rubbing along.
Marriage seems stupid enough and dull enough and annoying
enough, but as a matter of fact it would be ever so much
worse if the man wasn’t there at all; yes, however wrong the
man may be. We’ve got to learn to stick it; whether the <span class='it'>it</span>
is a pimple on one’s nose or a husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s so easy to talk.” Mrs. Lester shook her shoulders
impatiently. “One has theories and it’s very nice to
spread them out, but in practice it’s quite different. Fred’s
been perfectly beastly these last few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Lady Gale, “don’t run a risk of losing him.
I mean that quite seriously. One thinks that one’s got a
man so safely that one can play any game one likes, and
then suddenly the man’s gone; and then, my dear, you’re
sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re dreadfully serious to-night. I wanted to be
amused, and instead of that you speak as if I were on the
verge of something dreadful. I’m not a bit. It’s only
Fred that’s cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I don’t think you’re on the verge of anything
dreadful.” Lady Gale bent down and kissed her. “It’s
only that Treliss is a funny place. It has its effect—well,
it’s rather hard to say—but on our nerves, I suppose. We
are all of us excited and would do things, perhaps, here that
we shouldn’t dream of doing anywhere else. Things look
differently here.” She paused a moment, then she added,
“It’s all rather worrying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, I’m a pig,” said Mrs. Lester, leaning over and
kissing her. “Don’t bother about me and my little things.
But why are you worrying? Is it Tony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose it is,” said Lady Gale slowly; “it’s
quite silly of me, but we’re all of us rather moving in the
dark. Nobody knows what anyone else is doing. And then
there’s Alice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What exactly has she got to do with it?” asked Mrs.
Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, she has everything.” Lady Gale sighed.
You must have heard when you were in town that she
was, more or less, ‘allotted’ to Tony. Of course it hadn’t
actually come to any exact words, but it was very generally
understood. I myself hadn’t any doubt about the matter.
They were to come down here to fix it all up. As a matter
of fact, coming down here has undone the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course I’d heard something,” said Mrs. Lester.
“As a matter of fact I had been wondering rather. Of
course I could see that it wasn’t, so to speak, coming off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Something’s happened to Tony since he came
down, and to Alice too, for that matter. But at first I
didn’t worry; in fact, quite between ourselves, I was rather
glad. In town they were neither of them very keen about
it; it was considered a suitable thing and they were going
to fall in with it, and they were quite nice enough, both of
them, to have carried it on all right afterwards. But that
wasn’t the kind of marriage that I wanted for Tony. He’s
too splendid a fellow to be lost and submerged in that kind
of thing; it’s too ordinary, too drab. And so, when he came
down here, I saw at once that something had happened, and
I was glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” said Mrs. Lester, her eyes shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I asked him nothing. That has always been our
plan, that he shall tell me if he wants to, but otherwise I
leave it alone. And it has worked splendidly. He has
always told me. But this time it is rather different. As
soon as he told me anything I should have to act. If he
told me who the girl was I should have to see her, and then
you see, I must tell my husband. As soon as I know about
it I become the family, and I <span class='it'>hate</span> the family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester could feel Lady Gale’s hand quiver on her
arm. “Oh, my dear, you don’t know what it has always
been. Before Tony came life was a lie, a lie from the very
beginning. I was forced to eat, to sleep, to marry, to bear
children, as the family required. Everything was to be
done with one eye on the world and another on propriety.
I was hot, impetuous in those days, now I am getting old
and calm enough, God knows; I have learnt my lesson, but
oh! it took some learning. Rupert was like the rest; I soon
saw that there was no outlet there. But then Tony came,
and there was something to live for. I swore that he should
live his life as he was meant to live it, no square pegs in
round holes for him, and so I have watched and waited and
hoped. And now, at last, romance has come to him. I
don’t know who she is; but you’ve seen, we’ve all seen, the
change in him, and he shall seize it and hold it with both
hands, only, you see, I must not know. As soon as I know,
the thing becomes official, and then there’s trouble. Besides,
I trust him. I know that he won’t do anything rotten because
he’s Tony. I was just a little bit afraid that he might
do something foolish, but I’ve put Mr. Maradick there as
guard, and the thing’s safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Maradick?” asked Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Tony’s devoted to him, and he has just that
stolid matter-of-fact mind that will prevent the boy from
doing anything foolish. Besides, I like him. He’s not
nearly so stupid as he seems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think he seems at all stupid,” said Mrs. Lester,
“I think he’s delightful. But tell me, if they were neither
of them very keen and the thing’s off, why are you worried?
Surely it is the very best thing that could possibly happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that was before they came down.” Lady Gale shook
her head. “Something’s happened to Alice. Since she’s
been down here she’s fallen in love with Tony. Yes, wildly.
I had been a little afraid of it last week, and then last night
she came to me and spoke incoherently about going away
and hating Treliss and all sorts of things jumbled up together
and then, of course, I saw at once. It is really very
strange in a girl like Alice. I used to think that I never
knew anyone more self-contained and sensible, but now I’m
afraid that she’s in for a bad time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If one only knew,” said Mrs. Lester, “what exactly it is
that Tony <span class='it'>is</span> doing; we’re all in the dark. Of course, Mr.
Maradick could tell us.” She paused for a moment, and
then she said suddenly: “Have you thought at all of the
effect it may be having on Mr. Maradick? All this business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Being with Tony, you mean?” said Lady Gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the whole affair. He’s middle-aged and solid, of
course, but he seems to me to have—how can one put it?—well,
considerable inclinations to be young again. You
know one can’t be with Tony without being influenced, and
he <span class='it'>is</span> influenced, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale put her hand on the other’s sleeve. “Millie,”
she said very earnestly, “look here. Leave him alone. I
mean that seriously, dear. He’s not a man to be played
with, and it isn’t really worth the candle. You love Fred
and Fred loves you; just stick to that and don’t worry about
anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester laughed. “How perfectly absurd! As if I
cared for Mr. Maradick in that kind of way! Why, I’ve
only known him a few days, and, anyway, it’s ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Lady Gale, “this place seems to
have been playing tricks with all of us. I’m almost afraid
of it; I wish we were going away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said no more then, but the conversation had given
Lady Gale something more to think about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert, his father and Alice came in together. It was
half-past eight and quite time to go down. Sir Richard
was, as usual, impatient of all delay, and so they went down
without waiting for Tony and Mr. Lester. The room was
not very full when they came in; most people had dined,
but the Maradicks were there at their usual table by the
window. The two little girls were sitting straight in their
chairs with their eyes fixed on their plates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester thought that Alice Du Cane looked very calm
and self-possessed, and wondered whether Lady Gale hadn’t
made a mistake. However, Tony would come in soon and
then she would see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can imagine what it’s like at home,” she said as
she settled herself in her chair and looked round the room.
“Thick, please” (this to the waiter). “Fred never knows
when a meal ought to begin, never. He must always finish
a page or a sentence or something, and the rest of the world
goes hang. Alice, my dear” (she smiled at her across the
table), “never marry an author.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her blue dress was quite as beautiful as she thought it
was, and it suited her extraordinarily well. Mrs. Lester’s
dresses always seemed perfectly natural and indeed inevitable,
as though there could never, by any possible chance,
have been anything at that particular moment that would
have suited her better. She did not spend very much money
on dress and often made the same thing do for a great many
different occasions, but she was one of the best-dressed women
in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Mr. Bannister, the landlord, rolled round the room
and spoke to his guests. This was a function that he performed
quite beautifully, with an air and a grace that was
masterly in its combination of landlord and host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flattered Sir Richard, listened to complaints, speculated
about the weather, and passed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear! it’s so hot!” said Lady Gale, “let’s hurry
through and get outside. I shall stifle in here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sir Richard was horrified at the idea of hurrying
through. When your meals are the principal events of the
day you don’t intend to hurry through them for anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tony came in. He stopped for a moment at the
Maradicks’ table and said something to Maradick. As he
came towards his people everyone noticed his expression.
He always looked as though he found life a good thing, but
to-night he seemed to be alive with happiness. They had
seen Tony pleased before, but never anything like this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you’d found something,” said Rupert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I’m late,” said Tony. “No soup, thanks, much
too hot for soup. What, father? Yes, I know, but I hurried
like anything, only a stud burst and then I couldn’t find
a sock, and then—Oh! yes, by the way, Fred says he’s awfully
sorry, but he’ll be down in a minute. He never noticed
how late it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never does,” said Mrs. Lester, moving impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can forgive a man anything if he writes ‘To
Paradise,’” said Tony. “Hullo, Alice, where on earth have
you been all day? I looked for you this morning and you
simply weren’t to be found; skulking in your tent, I suppose.
But why women should always miss the best part of
the day by sticking in their rooms till lunch——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I overslept,” she said, laughing. “It was after the
picnic and the thunder and everything.” She smiled across
the table quite composedly at him, and Mrs. Lester wondered
at her self-possession. She had watched her face
when he came in, and she knew now beyond all possible doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor thing,” she said to herself, “she is in for a bad
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maradicks had left the room, the Gales were almost
alone; the silver moon played with the branches of the birch
trees, the lights from the room flung pools and rivers of gold
across the paths, the flowers slept. Sir Richard finished his
“poire Melba” and grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have our coffee outside,” said Lady Gale. Outside
in the old spot by the wall Tony found Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he whispered, “is it safe, do you suppose, to be
so happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it while you can,” said Maradick. “But it won’t
be all plain sailing, you mustn’t expect that. And look
here, Tony, things are going on very fast. I am in a way
responsible. I want to know exactly what you intend to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To do?” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I want it put down practically in so many words.
I’m here to look after you. Lady Gale trusts me and is
watching me. I <span class='it'>must</span> know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why! I’m going to marry her of course. You dear old
thing, what on earth do you suppose? Of course I don’t
exactly know that she cares—in that sort of way, I mean.
She didn’t say anything in the garden this afternoon, in so
many words. But I think that I understood, though of
course a fellow may be wrong; but anyhow, if she doesn’t
care now she will in a very little time. But I say, I haven’t
told you the best of it all. I believe old Morelli’s awfully
keen about it. Anyhow, to-day when we were talking to
Miss Minns he spoke to me and said that he was awfully
glad that I came, that it was so good for Janet having a
young friend, and that he hoped that I would come and see
her as often as I could. And then he actually said that I
might take her out one afternoon for a row, that she would
like it and it would be good for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand him,” said Maradick, shaking his
head. “I don’t know what he wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s obvious enough,” said Tony, “he thinks that
it will be a good match. And I think he wants to get rid
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it’s quite as simple as that,” said Maradick;
“I wish I did. But to come back to the main question,
what do you mean to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tony, feeling in his pocket, “look here, I’ve
written a letter. I didn’t see why one should waste time.
I’ll read it to you.” He stepped out of the shadow into the
light from one of the windows and read it:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Miss Morelli</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your father suggested this afternoon that you might come
for a row one day. There’s no time like the present, so
could you possibly come to-morrow afternoon (Thursday)?
I should suggest rather late, say four, because it’s so frightfully
hot earlier. I’ll bring tea. If Miss Minns and your
father cared to come too it would be awfully jolly.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Yours sincerely</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Anthony Gale</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PS.—Will you be on the beach by Morna Pool about
four?</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” he said as he put it back, “I think that will
do. Of course they won’t come. It would be perfectly
dreadful if they did. But they won’t. I could see that in
his face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then! Well, I suppose, one day or other, I shall
ask her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And after that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then I shall ask Morelli.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he says no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I should think it more than likely. You
won’t be able to say that your parents have consented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I shouldn’t think he’d mind about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s his only daughter.” Maradick laid his hand
on Tony’s shoulder. “Look here, Tony, we’ve got to go
straight. Let’s look at the thing fair and square. If your
people and her people consented there’d be no question about
it. But they won’t. Your people never will and Morelli’s
not likely to. Then you must either give the whole thing up
or do it secretly. I say, give it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it up?” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there’ll be lots of trouble otherwise. Go away,
leave for somewhere or other to-morrow. You can think
of plenty of explanations. I believe it’s this place as much
as anything else that’s responsible for the whole business.
Once you’re clear of this you’ll see the whole thing quite
plainly and thank God for your escape. But if, after knowing
a girl a week, you marry her in defiance of everyone
wiser and better than yourself, you’ll rue the day, and be
tied to some one for life, some one of whom you really know
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Maradick!” Tony laughed. “You’ve got to
talk like that, I know; it’s your duty so to do. But I never
knew anyone say it so reluctantly; you’re really as keen
about it as I am, and you’d be most frightfully sick if I
went off to-morrow. Besides, it’s simply not to be thought
of. I’d much rather marry her and find it was a ghastly
mistake than go through life feeling that I’d missed something,
missed the best thing there was to have. It’s missing
things, not doing them wrong, that matters in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll go on anyhow?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow,” said Tony, “I’m of age. I’ve got means of
my own, and if she loves me then nothing shall stop me. If
necessary, we’ll elope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me,” said Maradick, shaking his head, “I really
oughtn’t to be in it at all. I told you so from the beginning.
But as you’ll go on whether I’m there or no, I suppose I must
stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night had influenced Mrs. Lester. She sat under
the birches in the shadow with her blue dress like a cloud
about her. She felt very romantic. The light in Tony’s
eyes at dinner had been very beautiful. Oh, dear! How
lovely it would be to get some of that romance back again!
During most of the year she was an exceedingly sane and
level-headed person. The Lesters were spoken of in London
as an ideal couple, as fond of each other as ever, but
with none of that silly sentiment. And so for the larger
part of the year it was; and then there came suddenly a
moment when she hated the jog-trot monotony of it all, when
she would give anything to regain that fire, that excitement,
that fine beating of the heart. To do her justice, she didn’t
in the least mind about the man, indeed she would have
greatly preferred that it should have been her husband;
she was much more in love with Romance, Sentiment, Passion,
fine abstract things with big capital letters, than any
one person; only, whilst the mood was upon her, she must
discover somebody. It was no use being romantic to the
wind or the stars or the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It really amounted to playing a game, and if Fred would
consent to play it with her it would be the greatest fun;
but then he wouldn’t. He had the greatest horror of emotional
scenes, and was always sternly practical with advice
about hot-water bottles and not sitting in a draught. He
did not, she told herself a hundred times a day, understand
her moods in the least. He had never let her help him the
least little bit in his work, he shut her out; she tossed her
head at the stars, gathered her blue dress about her, and went
up to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bedroom seemed enormous, and the shaded electric
light left caverns and spaces of darkness; the enormous bed
in the middle of the room seemed without end or boundary.
She heard her husband in the dressing-room, and she sat
down in front of her glass with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can go, Ferris,” she said to her maid, “I’ll manage
for myself to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to brush her hair; she was angry with the
things in the room, everything was so civilised and respectable.
The silver on the dressing-table, a blue pincushion, the
looking-glass; the blue dress, hanging over the back of a chair,
seemed in its reflexion to trail endlessly along the floor. She
brushed her hair furiously; it was very beautiful hair, and
she wondered whether Fred had ever noticed how beautiful
it was. Oh, yes! he’d noticed it in the early days; she remembered
how he had stroked it and what nice things he
had said. Ah! those early days had been worth having!
How exciting they had been! Her heart beat now at the remembrance
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard the door of the dressing-room close, and Fred
came in. He yawned; she glanced up. He was a little
shrimp of a man certainly, but he looked rather nice in his
blue pyjamas. He was brown, and his grey eyes were very
attractive. Although she did not know it, she loved every
inch of him from the top of his head to the sole of his foot,
but, just now, she wanted something that he had decided,
long ago, was bad for her. He had made what he would
have called a complete study of her nervous system, treating
her psychology as he would have treated the heroine of one
of his own novels. He was quite used to her fits of sentiment
and he knew that if he indulged her in the least the
complaint was aggravated and she was, at once, highly strung
and aggressively emotional. His own love for her was so
profound and deep that this “billing and cooing” seemed a
very unimportant and trivial affair, and he always put it
down with a firm hand. They mustn’t be children any
longer; they’d got past that kind of thing. There were
scenes, of course, but it only lasted for a very short time, and
then she was quite all right again. He never imagined her
flinging herself into anyone else because he would not give
her what she wanted. He was too sure of her affection for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had noticed that these attacks of “nerves,” as he
called them, were apt to come at Treliss, and he had therefore
rather avoided the place, but he found that it did, in
some curious way, affect him also, and especially his work.
The chapters that he wrote at Treliss had a rich, decorated
colour that he could not capture in any other part of the
world. Perhaps it was the medieval “feeling” of the place,
the gold and brown of the roofs and rocks, the purple and
blue of the sea and sky; but it went, as he knew, deeper than
that. That spirit that influenced and disturbed his wife influenced
also his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been quarrelling for two days, and he saw with
relief her smile as he came into the room. Their quarrels
disturbed his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, Fred. Don’t yawn; it’s rude. I’ve forgiven
you, although you have been perfectly hateful these
last few days. I think it’s ripping of me to have anything
to do with you. But, as a matter of fact, you’re not a bad
old thing and you look rather sweet in blue pyjamas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her hand on his arm for a moment and then took
his hand. He looked at her rather apprehensively; it might
mean simply that it was the end of the quarrel, but it might
mean that she had one of her moods again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, old girl,” he said, smiling down at her, “I’m most
awfully sleepy. I don’t know what there is about this place,
but I simply can’t keep awake. It’s partly the weather, I
suppose. But anyhow, if you don’t awfully mind I think
I’ll go off to sleep. I’m jolly glad you aren’t angry any
more. I know I was rather silly, but the book’s a bit of a
bother just now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He yawned again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you <span class='it'>shan’t</span> go to bed just yet, you sleepy old thing.
I really don’t feel as though I’d seen anything of you at
all this week. And I want to hear all about everything, all
about the book. You haven’t told me a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved his hand. “I say, my dear, you’ll be getting
the most frightful cold sitting in a draught like that. You’d
much better come to bed and we’ll talk to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she smiled at him. “No, Fred, I’m going to talk
to you. I’m going to give you a sermon. You haven’t been
a bit nice to me all this time here. I know I’ve been horrid,
but then that’s woman’s privilege; and you know a
woman’s only horrid because she wants a man to be nice,
and I wanted you to be nice. This summer weather and
everything makes it seem like those first days, the honeymoon
at that sweet little place in Switzerland, you remember.
That night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She sighed and pressed his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He patted her hand. “Yes, dear, of course I remember.
Do you suppose I shall ever forget it? We’ll go out to-morrow
somewhere and have an afternoon together alone. Without
these people hanging round. I ought to get the chapter
finished to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved back from the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What chapter, dear?” She leaned back over the chair,
looking up in his face. “You know, I wish you’d let me
share your work a little. I don’t know how many years
we haven’t been married now, and you’ve always kept me
outside it. A wife ought to know about it. Just at first
you did tell me things a little and I was so frightfully interested.
And I’m sure I could help you, dear. There are
things a woman knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at the thought of the way that she would help
him. He would never be able to show her the necessity of
doing it all alone, both for him and for her. That part of
his life he must keep to himself. He remembered that he
had thought before their marriage that she would be able to
help. She had seemed so ready to sympathise and understand.
But he had speedily discovered the hopelessness of
it. Not only was she of no assistance, but she even hindered
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the feeble, the bad parts of the book and praised;
she handled his beautiful delicacy, the so admirably balanced
sentences, the little perfect expressions that had flown to him
from some rich Paradise where they had waited during an
eternity of years for some one to use them—she had taken
these rare treasures of his and trampled on them, flung them
to the winds, demanded their rejection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never for a moment seen his work at all; the
things that she had seen had not been there, the things that
she had not seen were the only jewels that he possessed.
The discovery had not pained him; he had not loved her for
<span class='it'>that</span>, the grasping and sharing of his writing, but for the
other things that were there for him, just as charmingly as
before. But he could not bear to have his work touched
by the fingers of those who did not understand. When people
came and asked him about it and praised it just because
it was the thing to do, he felt as though some one had flung
some curtain aside and exposed his body, naked, to a grinning
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was this, in a lesser degree, that she did. She was
only asking, like the rest, because it was the thing to do, because
she would be able to say to the world that she helped
him; she did not care for the thing, its beauty and solemnity
and grace, she did not even see that it <span class='it'>was</span> beautiful, solemn,
or graceful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind my work, dear,” he said. “One wants to
fling it off when one’s out of it. You don’t want to know
about the book. Why, I don’t believe you’ve ever read ‘To
Paradise’ right through; now, have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course, I <span class='it'>loved</span> it, although there <span class='it'>were</span>, as a
matter of fact, things that I could have told you about women.
Your heroine, for instance——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He interrupted hurriedly. “Well, dear, let’s go to
bed now. We’ll talk to-morrow about anything you like.”
He moved across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked angrily into the glass. She could feel that
little choke in her throat and her eyes were burning. She
tapped the table impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s a little hard,” she said, “that one’s husband
should behave as if one were a complete stranger, or, worse
still, an ordinary acquaintance. You might perhaps take
more interest in a stranger. I don’t think I want very
much, a little sympathy and some sign of affection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sitting on the bed. “That’s all right, dear, only
you must admit that you’re a little hard to understand. Here
during the last two days you’ve been as cross as it’s possible
for anyone to be about nothing at all, and then suddenly you
want one to slobber. You go up and down so fast that it’s
simply impossible for an ordinary mortal to follow you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that charming?” she said, looking at the blue pincushion,
“such a delightful way to speak to one’s wife.”
Then suddenly she crossed over to him. “No, dear. I
didn’t mean that really, it was silly of me. Only I do need
a little sympathy sometimes. Little things, you know, matter
to us women; we remember and notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right.” He put his arm round her neck and
kissed her, then he jumped into bed. “We’ll talk to-morrow.”
He nestled into the clothes with a little sigh of satisfaction;
in a moment he was snoring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat on the bed and stared in front of her. Her hair
was down and she looked very young. Most of the room
was in shadow, but her dressing-table glittered under the
electric light; the silver things sparkled like jewels, the
gleam fell on the blue dress and travelled past it to the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swung her feet angrily. How dare he go to sleep
all in a moment in that ridiculous manner? His kiss had
seemed a step towards sentiment, and now, in a moment, he
was snoring. Oh! that showed how much he cared! Why
had she ever married him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the thought of the splendid times that she might have
been having with some one else, with some splendid strong
man who could take her in his arms until she could scarcely
breathe, some one who would understand her when she
wanted to talk and not go fast off to sleep, some one, well, like
Mr. Maradick, for instance, her eyes glittered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at the room, moved across the floor and
switched off the lights. She crept into bed, moving as far
away from her husband as possible. He didn’t care—nobody
cared—she belonged to nobody in the world. She began
to sob, and then she thought, of the picnic; well, he had
cared and understood. He would not have gone to sleep
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. soon she was dreaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the other person upon whom the weather had had
some effect was Mrs. Maradick. It could not be said that
weather, as a rule, affected her at all, and perhaps even now
things might be put down to the picnic; but the fact remains
that for the first time in her selfish little life she was unhappy.
She had been wounded in her most sensitive spot,
her vanity. It did not need any very acute intelligence to
see that she was not popular with the people in the hotel.
The picnic had shown it to her quite conclusively, and she
had returned in a furious passion. They had been quite nice
to her, of course, but it did not need a very subtle woman
to discover their real feelings. Fifteen years of Epsom’s
admiration had ill-prepared her for a harsh and unsympathetic
world, and she had never felt so lonely in her life
before. She hated Lady Gale and Mrs. Lester bitterly from
the bottom of her heart, but she would have given a very
great deal, all her Epsom worshippers and more, for some
genuine advance on their part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was waiting now in her room for her husband to come
in. She was sitting up in bed looking very diminutive indeed,
with her little sharp nose and her bright shining eyes
piercing the shadows; she had turned out the lights, except
the one by the bed. She did not know in the least what she
was going to say to him, but she was angry and sore and
lonely; she was savage with the world in general and with
James in particular. She bit her lips and waited. He came
in softly, as though he expected to find her asleep, and then
when he saw her light he started. His bed was by the window
and he moved towards it. Then he stopped and saw
her sitting up in bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emmy! You still awake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked enormous in his pyjamas; he could see his muscles
move beneath the jacket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! must we? Now?” he said. “It seems very late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the only opportunity that one gets nowadays,” she
said, her eyes flaring, “you are so much engaged.” It made
her furious to see him looking so clean and comfortably
sleepy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Engaged?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! we needn’t go into that,” she answered. “One
doesn’t really expect to see anything of one’s husband in
these modern times, it isn’t the thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t remind her that during the last fifteen years
she hadn’t cared very much whether he were lonely or not.
He looked at her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s start that all over again now,” he said. “I
would have spent the whole time with you if you hadn’t so
obviously shown me that you didn’t want me. You can
hardly have forgotten already what you said the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that’s quite true?” she said, looking up
at him; she was gripping the bedclothes in her hands.
“Don’t you think that it’s a little bit because there’s some
one else who did, or rather <span class='it'>does</span>, want you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” he said, coming towards her bed.
She was suddenly frightened. This was the man whom she
had seen for the first time on that first evening at dinner,
some one she had never known before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean what I say,” she answered. “How long do you
suppose that I intend to stand this sort of thing? You leave
me deliberately alone; <span class='it'>I</span> don’t know what you do with your
days, <span class='it'>or</span> your evenings, neither does anyone else. I’m not
going to be made a laughing-stock of in the hotel; all those
beastly women .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She could scarcely speak for rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to talk about,” he answered sternly.
“It’s only your own imagination. At any rate, we are not
going to have a scene now, nor ever again, as far as that
goes. I’m sick of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she answered furiously, “if you think I’m going
to sit there and let myself be made a fool of and say nothing
you’re mightily mistaken; I’ve had enough of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so have I,” he answered quietly. “If you’re tired
of this place we’ll go away somewhere else, wherever you
please; perhaps it would be a good thing. This place seems
to have upset you altogether. Perhaps after all it would
be the best thing. It would cut all the knots and end all
these worries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she laughed scornfully. “Oh! no, thank you. I like
the place well enough. Only you must be a little more careful.
And if you think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he cut her short. “I don’t think anything about it,”
he said. “I’m tired of talking. This place <span class='it'>has</span> made a
difference, it’s true. It’s shown me some of the things that
I’ve missed all these years; I’ve been going along like a
cow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and now for the future it’s going to be different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! it’s not only the place,” she sneered. “Mrs. Lester——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the word he suddenly bent down and held her by
the shoulders. His face was white; he was shaking with
anger. He was so strong that she felt as though he was
going to crush her into nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he whispered, “leave that alone. I won’t
have it, do you hear? I won’t have it. You’ve been riding
me too long, you and your nasty dirty little thoughts; now
I’m going to have my own way. You’ve had yours long
enough; leave me alone. Don’t drive me too far.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let her drop back on the pillows. She lay there without
a word. He stole across the room on his naked feet and
switched out the lights. She heard him climb into bed.</p>

<h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>OF LOVE—AND THEREFORE TO BE SKIPPED BY ALL THOSE</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>WHO ARE TIRED OF THE SUBJECT</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the knoll the afternoon sun hung in a golden
mist. The heat veiled it, and the blue of the surrounding
sky faded into golden shadows near its circle and swept
in a vast arc to limitless distance. The knoll, humped like
a camel’s back, stood out a vivid green against the darker
wall of trees behind it. Far below, the white sand of the
cove caught the sun and shone like a pearl, and beyond it
was the blue carpet of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli sat, cross-legged, on the knoll. In his hands was
his flute, but he was staring straight below him down on to
the cove. He waited, the air was heavy with heat; a crimson
butterfly hovered for a moment in front of him and then
swept away, a golden bee buzzed about his head and then
lumbered into the air. There was silence; the trees stood
rigid in the heat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Morelli moved. Two black specks appeared
against the white shadows of the beach; he began to play.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Punch was lying on the cliff asleep. To his right, curving
towards the white sand, was a sea-pool slanting with
green sea-weed down into dark purple depths. The sun beat
upon the still surface of it and changed it into burning gold.
Below this the sea-weed flung green shadows across the rock.
It reflected through the gold the straight white lines of the
road above it, and the brown stem, sharp like a sword, of
a slender poplar. It seemed to pass through the depths of
the pool into endless distance. Besides the green of the sea-weed
and the gold of the sun there was the blue of the sky
reflected, and all these lights and colours mingled and passed
and then mingled again as in the curving circle of a pearl
shell. Everything was metallic, with a hard outline like
steel, under the blazing sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned the corner and came down the hill. He was
in flannels and carried in one hand a large tea-basket. His
body, long and white, was reflected in the green and blue of
the pool. It spread in little ripples driven by a tiny wind
in white shadows to the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was whistling, and then suddenly he saw Toby and
Punch asleep in the grass. He stopped for a moment in
the road and looked at them. Then he passed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white sand gleamed and sparkled in the sun; the
little wind had passed from the face of the pool, and there
was no movement at all except the very soft and gentle
breaking of tiny waves on the sand’s edge. A white bird
hanging for the moment motionless in the air, a tiny white
cloud, the white edge of the breaking ripples, broke the blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony sat down. From where he was sitting he could see
the town rising tier upon tier into a peak. It lay panting
in the sun like a beast tired out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immediate problem was whether Morelli or Miss
Minns would come. A tiny note in a tiny envelope had arrived
at the “Man at Arms” that morning. It had said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Gale</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thank you so very much. It is charming of you to ask
us. We shall be delighted to come.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Yours sincerely</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Janet Morelli</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It wasn’t like her, and short though it was he felt sure that
somebody had watched her whilst she did it. And “we”?
For whom did that stand? He had felt so sure in his heart
of hearts that no one except Janet would come that he was,
at first, bitterly disappointed. What a farce the whole thing
would be if anyone else were there! He laughed sarcastically
at the picture of Miss Minns perched horribly awry at
the end of the boat, forcing, by her mere presence, the conversation
into a miserable stern artificiality. And then suppose
it were Morelli? But it wouldn’t be, of that he was
sure; Morelli had other things to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced for a moment up to the cliff where Punch
was. He didn’t want the whole town to know what he was
about. Punch could keep a secret, of course, he had kept
a good many in his time, but it might slip out; not that
there was anything to be ashamed of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, he had had some difficulty in getting
away from the hotel; they had been about him like bees,
wanting him to do things. He had noticed, too, that his
mother was anxious. Since the day of the picnic she had
watched him, followed him with her eyes, had evidently
longed to ask him what he was going to do. That, he knew,
was her code, that she should ask him nothing and should
wait; but he felt that she was finding the waiting very difficult.
He was quite sure in his own mind that Alice had
spoken to her, and, although he would give everything in
the world to be pleasant and easy, he found, in spite of himself,
that he was, when he talked to her, awkward and
strained. There was something new and strange in her attitude
to him, so that the old cameraderie was quite hopelessly
gone, and the most ordinary conventional remark about the
weather became charged with intensest meaning. This all
contrived to make things at the hotel very awkward, and
everyone was in that state of tension which forced them to
see hidden mysteries in everything that happened or was
said. The Lesters had been barely on speaking terms at
breakfast time and Maradick hadn’t appeared at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, when the afternoon had come, his mother had asked
him to come out with them. He had had to refuse, and had
only been able to give the vaguest of reasons. They knew
that he was not going with Mr. Maradick, because he had
promised to walk with Mr. Lester. What was he going to
do? He spoke of friends in the town and going for a row.
It had all been very unpleasant. Life was, in fact, becoming
immensely complicated, and if Miss Minns were to appear he
would have all this worry and trouble for nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed furiously at the hard white road. The pool
shone like a mirror; the road, the poplar, the sky were
painted on its surface in hard vivid outline. Suddenly a
figure was reflected in it. Some one in a white dress with
a large white hat, her reflexion spread across the length of
the pool. The water caught a mass of golden hair and held
it for a moment, then it was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s eyes, straining towards the hill, suddenly saw her;
she was alone. When he saw her his heart began to beat so
furiously that for a moment he could not move. Then he
sprang to his feet. He must not be too sure. Perhaps Miss
Minns was late. He watched her turn down the path and
come towards him. She was looking very cool and collected
and smiling at him as she crossed the sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a lovely day?” she said, shaking hands. “I’m
not late, am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I was rather early;” and then, suddenly, “Is Miss
Minns coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” Janet laughed, “it was far too hot. She is
sleeping with all the curtains drawn and the doors and windows
shut. Only I’m not to be late. Oh, dear! What fun!
Where’s the boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excitement of hearing that she really was alone was
very nearly too much for Tony. He wanted to shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, I’m so glad. No, I don’t mean to be rude
really; I think Miss Minns awfully decent, simply ripping”
(this, I am afraid, due to general pleasure rather than strict
veracity), “but it would have put a bit of a stopper on the
talking, wouldn’t it? and you know there are simply tons
of things that I want to talk about. The boat’s round here,
round the corner over these rocks. I thought we’d row to
Mullin’s Cave, have tea, and come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved across the sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch had woke at the sound of voices and now was
staring in front of him. He recognised both of them. “The
couple of babies,” he said, and he sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that precise moment some one else came down the
path. It was Alice du Cane. She carried a pink parasol.
Her figure lay for a moment on the surface of the pool.
She was looking very pretty, but she was very unhappy.
They had asked her to go out with them, but she had refused
and had pleaded a headache. And then she had hated the
gloom and silence of her room. She knew what it was that
she wanted, although she refused to admit it to herself. She
pretended that she wanted the sea, the view, the air; and
so she went out. She told herself a hundred times a day
that she must go away, must leave the place and start afresh
somewhere else. That was what she wanted; another place
and she would soon forget. And then there would come
fierce self-reproach and miserable contempt. She, Alice du
Cane, who had prided herself on her self-control? The
kind of girl who could quote Henley with satisfaction, “Captain
of her soul?” At the turn of the road she saw Punch
and Toby; then across the white sand of the cove two figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said good-day, and she smiled at him. Then for a
moment she stopped. It was Tony, she could hear his laugh;
he gave the girl his hand to cross the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A beautiful day, isn’t it?” she said to Punch, and passed
down the road.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>They found the boat round the corner of the rocks lying
with its clean white boards and blue paint. It lay with a
self-conscious air on the sand, as though it knew at what
ceremony it was to attend. It gurgled and chuckled with
pleasure as it slipped into the water. Whilst he busied himself
with the oars she stood silently, her hands folded in
front of her, looking out to sea. “I’ve always wanted to
know,” she said, “what there is right out there on the other
side. One used to fancy a country, like any child, with
mountains and lakes, black sometimes and horrible when
one was in a bad mood, and then, on other days, beautiful
and full of sun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said very little as the boat moved out; the cove
rapidly dwindled into a shining circle of silver sand; the
rocks behind it assumed shapes, dragons and mandarins and
laughing dogs, the town mounted like a pyramid into the
sky and some of it glittered in the light of the sun like diamonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet tried to realise her sensations. In the first place
she had never been out in a boat before; secondly, she had
never been really alone with Tony before; thirdly, she had
had no idea that she would have felt so silent as she did.
There were hundreds of things that she wanted to say, and
yet she sat there tongue-tied. She was almost afraid of
breaking the silence, as though it were some precious vase
and she was tempted to fling a stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony too felt as though he were in church. He rowed
with his eyes fixed on the shore, and Janet. Now that the
great moment had actually arrived he was frightened.
Whatever happened, the afternoon would bring tremendous
consequences with it. If she laughed at him, or was amazed
at his loving her, then he felt that he could never face the
long dreary stretches of life in front of him; and if she
loved him, well, a good many things would have to happen.
He realised, too, that a number of people were bound up
with this affair of his; his mother, Alice, the Maradicks,
even the Lesters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t mind your coming alone?” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, why should they?” she said, laughing. “Besides,
father approves of you enormously, and I’m so glad!
He’s never approved of anyone as a companion before, and
it makes such a difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he kind to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! Why, of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you want to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must know; I want to know all about it. We can’t
be real friends unless there’s complete confidence. That’s
the best of being the ages we are. As things are, we can’t
have very much to hide, but later on people get all sorts of
things that they have done and said that they keep locked
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Janet, smiling, “I haven’t got anything to
hide. I’ll try and tell you all you want to know. But it’s
very difficult, about father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, I haven’t known other people’s fathers
at all, and up to quite lately I didn’t think there was anything
peculiar about mine, but just lately I’ve been wondering.
You see there’s never been any particular affection,
there hasn’t been any question of affection, and that’s,” she
stopped for a moment, “that’s what I’ve been wanting. I
used to make advances when I was quite tiny, climb on his
knee, and sometimes he would play, oh! beautifully! and
then suddenly he would stop and push me aside, or behave,
perhaps, as though I were not there at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brute!” said Tony between his teeth, driving the oar
furiously through the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then I began to see gradually that he didn’t care at
all. It was easy enough even for a girl as young as I was
to understand, and yet he would sometimes be so affectionate.”
She broke off. “I think,” she said, looking steadily
out to sea, “that he would have liked to have killed me sometimes.
He is so furious at times that he doesn’t in the
least know what he’s doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do when he was like that?” asked Tony
in a very low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, one waits,” she said very quietly, “they don’t last
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke dispassionately, as though she were outside
the case altogether, but Tony felt that if he had Morelli
there, in the boat with him, he would know what to do and
say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must get away,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other things about him,” she went on, “that
I’ve noticed that other people’s fathers don’t do. He’s wonderful
with animals, and yet he doesn’t seem really to care
about them, or, at least, he only cares whilst they are in certain
moods. And although they come to him so readily I
often think that they are really afraid as I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to think as she sat there. She had never spoken
about it all to anyone before, and so it had never, as it
were, materialised. She had never realised until now how
badly she had wanted to talk to some one about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you have been so fortunate,” she said, a little wistfully,
“to have done so many things and seen so many people.
Tell me about other girls, are they all beautiful? Do
they dress beautifully?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, looking at her. “They are very tiresome.
I can’t be serious with girls as a rule. That’s why I like
to be with you. You don’t mind a fellow being serious.
Girls seem to think a man isn’t ever meant to drop his grin,
and it gets jolly tiresome. Because, you know, life is awfully
serious when you come to think about it. I’ve only
realised,” he hesitated a moment, “during this last fortnight
how wonderful it is. That’s, you know,” he went on hurriedly,
“why I really like to be with men better. Now a
fellow like Maradick understands what one’s feeling, he’s
been through it, he’s older, and he knows. But then you
understand too; it’s jolly funny how well you understand a
chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped his oars for a moment and the boat drifted.
They were rounding the point, and the little sandy beach for
which they were making crept timidly into sight. There
was perfect stillness; everything was as though it were
carved from stone, the trees on the distant hill, the hanging
curtain of sky, the blue mirror of the sea, the sharply
pointed town. A flock of white sheep, tiny like a drifting
baby cloud, passed for a moment against the horizon on the
brow of the hill. There was a very faint sound of bells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both very silent. The oars cut through the
water, the boat gave a little sigh as it pushed along, there
was no other sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat on the beach and made tea. Tony had thought
of everything. There was a spirit lamp, and the kettle
bubbled and hissed and spluttered. Tony busied himself
about the tea because he didn’t dare to speak. If he said
the very simplest thing he knew that he would lose all self-control.
She was sitting against a rock with her dress spread
around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him with big, wide-open eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name is Tony, isn’t it?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it is short for Anthony. I shall call you
Tony. But see, there is something that I want to say. You
will never now, after we have been such friends, let it go
again, will you? Because it has been so wonderful meeting
you, and has made such a difference to me that I couldn’t
bear it. If you went away, and you had other friends and—forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped a plate on to the sand and came towards
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet.” He dropped on to his knees beside her. “I
must tell you. I love you, I love you, Janet. I don’t care
whether you are angry or not, and if you don’t feel like that
then I will be an awfully decent friend and won’t bother you
about love. I’ll never talk about it. And anyhow, I ought,
I suppose, to give you time; a little because you haven’t seen
other fellows, and it’s not quite fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t touch her, but knelt on the sand, looking up
into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked down at him and laughed. “Why, how silly,
Tony dear, I’ve loved you from the first moment that I saw
you; why, of course, you must have known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their hands touched, and at that moment Tony realised
the wonderful silence and beauty of the world. The sea
spread before them like a carpet, but it was held with the
rocks and sand and sky in breathless tension by God for one
immortal second. Nature waited for a moment to hear the
story that it had heard so often before, then when the divine
moment had passed the world went on its course once more.
But in that moment things had happened. A new star had
been born in the sky, the first evening star, and it sparkled
and glittered above the town; in the minstrels’ room at that
moment the sun shone and danced on the faces of the lions,
beneath the tower the apple-woman paused in her knitting
and nodded her head solemnly at some secret pleasant
thought, on the knoll the birds clustered in chattering excitement,
far on the horizon a ship with gleaming sails rose
against the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet, darling.” He bent down and kissed her hand.
Then he raised his face, hers bent down to his—they kissed.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later they were in the boat again; she sat
on the floor with her head against his knee. He rowed very
slowly, which was natural, because it was difficult to move
the oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening lights began to creep across the sky, and the
sun sank towards the horizon; other stars had stolen into
the pale blue sky; near the sea a pale orange glow, as of a
distant fire, burned. The boat shone like a curved and
shining pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony had now a difficult business in front of him. The
situation had to be made clear to her that his people must
not be told. He was quite resolved within himself in what
way he was going to carry the situation through, but he
could not at all see that she would consider the matter in the
same light. It would take time and considerable trouble to
convey to her a true picture of the complicated politics of
the Gale family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet, dear,” he said, “we have now to be sternly practical.
There are several things that have to be faced. In
the first place, there is your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, a little doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how will he take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.” She looked up at him and laid her hand
very lightly upon his knee. The yellow light had crept up
from the horizon, and was spreading in bands of colour over
the sky; the sea caught the reflexion very faintly, but the red
glow had touched the dark band of country behind them and
the white road, the still black trees were beginning to burn
as though with fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tony, “of course I shall tell him at once.
What will he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. One never can tell with father. But,
dear, must you? Couldn’t we wait? It is not that I mind
his knowing, but I am, in some way, afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he likes me,” said Tony; “you told me yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but his liking anybody never means very much.
It’s hard to explain; but it isn’t you that he likes so much
as something that you’ve got. It is always that with everybody.
I’ve seen it heaps of times. He goes about and picks
people up, and if they haven’t got the thing he’s looking for
he drops them at once and forgets them as soon as he can.
I don’t know what it is that he looks for exactly, but, whatever
it is, he finds it in the animals, and in the place even;
that’s why he lives at Treliss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet was very young about the world in general, but
about anything that she had herself immediately met she
was wise beyond her years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him a moment, and then added: “But of
course you must speak to him; it is the only thing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And suppose,” said Tony, “that he refuses to give his
consent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course,” Janet answered quietly, “then we must
go away. I belong to you now. Father does not care for
me in the least, and I don’t care for anyone in the world
except you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her calm acceptance of the idea that he himself had intended
to submit to her very tentatively indeed frightened
him. His responsibility seemed suddenly to increase ten-fold.
Her suggesting an elopement so quietly, and even
asserting it decisively as though there were no other possible
alternative, showed that she didn’t in the least realise what
it would all mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, of course,” she went on quietly, “there are
your people. What will they say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, dear. That’s the dreadful difficulty. They
mustn’t be told at all. The only person in the family who
really matters in the least is my mother, and she matters
everything. The governor and my brother care for me only
as the family, and they have to see that that isn’t damaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they’d think that I’d damage it?” said Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Tony, quietly, “they would. You see, dear,
in our set in town the two things that matter in marriage are
family and money. You’ve got to have either ancestors or
coin. Your ancestors, I expect, are simply ripping, but
they’ve got to be in Debrett, so that everyone can look them
up when the engagement’s announced. It isn’t you they’d
object to, but the idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see; well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if mother knew about it; if it was public she’d
have to support the family, of course. But really in her
heart of hearts what she wants is that I should be happy.
She’d much rather have that than anything else; so that if
we are married and it’s too late for anyone to say anything,
and she sees that we are happy, then it will be all right, but
she mustn’t know until afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stopped, but Janet said nothing. Then he went on:
“You see there was a sort of idea with people, before we
came down here, that I should get engaged to some one. It
was more or less an understood thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there, is there anyone especially?” asked Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a Miss Du Cane. We’d been pals for a long time
without thinking about marriage at all; and then people
began to say it was time for me to settle down, and rot like
that—and she seemed quite suitable, and so she was asked
down here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you care about her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! like a friend, of course. She’s a jolly good sort,
and used to be lots of fun, but as soon as all this business
came into it she altered and it became different. And then
I saw you, and there was never more any question of anyone
else in all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony dropped the oars and let the boat drift. He caught
her golden hair in his hands and twined it about his arm.
He bent down and touched her lips. She leaned up towards
him and they clung together. About them the sea was a
golden flame, the sky was a fiery red, the country behind them
was iron black. The boat danced like a petal out to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with her arm about his neck, Janet spoke again.
“Your father would like you to marry this lady?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He thinks that I am going to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! now I understand it all. You cannot tell them, of
course; I see that. We must do it first and tell them afterwards.
And father will never consent. I am sure of it.
Oh, dear! what fun! we must go away secretly; it will be
an elopement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a ripping rag!” said Tony eagerly. “Oh! darling,
I was so afraid that you would mind all those things,
and I didn’t want to tell you. But now that you take it
like that! And then, you see, that’s where Maradick comes
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Maradick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He’s really the foundation-stone of the whole affair.
It’s because mother trusts him so absolutely completely
that she’s feeling so safe. He knows all about it,
and has known all about it all the time. Mother depends on
him altogether; we all depend on him, and he’ll help us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun lay, like a tired warrior, on the breast of the
sea; the clouds, pink and red and gold, gathered about him.
The boat turned the creek and stole softly into the white
shelter of the cove. Above the heads of the lovers the stars
glittered, about them the land, purple and dark with its
shadows, crept in on every side. Some bell rang from the
town, there was the murmur of a train, the faint cry of some
distant sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their voices came softly in the dusk:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tony!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night fell.</p>

<h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>OUR MIDDLE-AGED HERO IS BURDENED BY RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>BUT BOLDLY UNDERTAKES THE ADVENTURE</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same afternoon Maradick finished “To Paradise.”
He read it in the room of the minstrels with the sun
beating through the panes in pools of gold on to the floor, the
windows flung wide open, and a thousand scents and sounds
flooding the air. The book had chimed in curiously with the
things that were happening to him; perhaps at any other
time, and certainly a year ago, he would have flung the book
aside with irritation at its slow movement and attenuated
action. Now it gave him the precisely correct sensation;
it was the atmosphere that he had most effectually realised
during these last weeks suddenly put for him clearly on to
paper. Towards the end of the book there was this passage:
“And indeed Nature sets her scene as carefully as any manager
on our own tiny stage; we complain discordantly of
fate, and curse our ill-luck when, in reality, it is because
we have disregarded our setting that we have suffered. Passing
lights, whether of sailing ships or huddled towns, murmuring
streams heard through the dark but not seen, the
bleating of countless sheep upon a dusky hill, are all, with a
thousand other formless incoherent things, but sign-posts to
show us our road. And let us, with pressing fingers, wilfully
close our ears and blind our eyes, then must we suffer.
Changes may come suddenly upon a man, and he will wonder;
but let him look around him and he will see that he is
subject to countless other laws and orders, and that he plays
but a tiny rôle in a vast and moving scene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and stretched his arms. He had not for twenty
years felt the blood race through his veins as it did to-day.
Money? Office stools? London? No; Romance, Adventure.
He would have his time now that it had come to him.
He could not talk to his wife about it; she would not understand;
but Mrs. Lester——</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened suddenly. He turned round. No one
had ever interrupted him there before; he had not known
that anyone else had discovered the place, and then he saw
that it was Lester himself. He came forward with that curious
look that he often had of seeing far beyond his immediate
surroundings. He stared now past the room into the blue
and gold of the Cornish dusk; the vague misty leaves of some
tree hung, a green cloud, against the sky, two tiny glittering
stars shone in the sky above the leaves, as though the branches
had been playing with them and had tossed them into the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! So you’ve discovered this place too?” He
came towards him with that charming, rather timid little
smile that he had. “I found it quite by chance yesterday,
and have been absolutely in love with it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick, “I’ve known it a long time. Curiously
enough, we were here last year and I never found it.”
Then he added: “I’ve just finished your book. May I tell
you how very much I’ve enjoyed it? It’s been quite a revelation
to me; its beauty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Lester, smiling, “it does one a lot of
good when one finds that some one has cared about one’s
work. I think that I have a special affection for this one,
it had more of myself in it. But will you forgive my saying
it, I had scarcely expected you, Maradick, to care about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Maradick. Lester’s voice was beautifully
soft and musical, and it seemed to be in tune with the room,
the scene, the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we are, you know, in a way at the opposite ends
of the pole. You are practical; a business man; it is your
work, your place in life, to be practical. I am a dreamer
through and through. I would have been practical if I could.
I have made my ludicrous attempts, but I have long ago
given it up. I have been cast for another rôle. The visions,
the theories, the story of such a man as I am must seem
stupidly, even weakly vague and insufficient to such a man as
you. I should not have thought that ‘To Paradise’ could
have seemed to you anything but a moonstruck fantasy. Perhaps
that is what it really is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke a little sadly, looking out at the sky. “I am
afraid that is what it is,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not possible,” said Maradick slowly, “that a man
should, at different times in his life, have played both rôles?
Can one not be practical and yet have one’s dreams? Can
one not have one’s dreams and yet be practical?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke he looked at the man and tried to see him
from Mrs. Lester’s point of view. He was little and brown
and nervous; his eyes were soft and beautiful, but they were
the eyes of a seer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lester shook his head. “I think it is possible to be
practical and yet to have your dreams. I will not deny that
you have yours; but the other thing—no, I shall never see
the world as it is. And yet, you know,” he went on, smiling
a little, “the world will never let me alone. I think that at
last I shall see that for which I have been searching, that
at last I shall hear that for which I have been listening so
long; and then suddenly the world breaks in upon it and
shatters it, and it vanishes away. One has one’s claims, one
is not alone; but oh! if I had only an hour when there might
be no interruption. But I’m really ashamed, Maradick; this
must seem, to put it bluntly, so much rot to you, and indeed
to anyone except myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Maradick. “I think I understand more than
you would expect. A month ago it might have been different,
but now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Lester, laughing, “the place has caught you,
as it does everyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not only the place,” said Maradick slowly, “there is
something else. I was here last year, but I did not feel, I
did not see as I do now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s Tony Gale as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Believe me, there’s nothing that a boy like that
cannot do with his happiness and youth. It goes out from
him and spreads like a magic wand. If people only knew
how much they owed to that kind of influence——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps it is Tony,” said Maradick, laughing.
“I am fonder of him than I can say; but, whatever the
cause, the dreams are there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lester took out a book from under his arm. It was long
and thin and bound in grey parchment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” he said, “is a book that perhaps you know. It
is one of the most beautiful comedies in our language. This
man was a dreamer too, and his dreams are amongst the
most precious things that we have. I may write to the end
of time, but I shall never reach that exquisite beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick took the book; it was Synge’s “Play-boy of the
Western World.” He had never heard of the man or of the
play. He turned its pages curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid,” he said, “that I’ve never heard of it.
It is Irish, I see. I think I do remember vaguely when the
Dublin players were in London last year hearing something.
The man has died, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and he didn’t leave very much behind him, but
what there is is of the purest gold. See, listen to this, one of
the greatest love-scenes in our language. It is a boy and a
girl in a lonely inn on an Irish moor.”</p>

<p class='line' style='margin-top:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>He read:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Girl.</span>—“What call have you to be that lonesome when there’s poor
girls walking Mayo in their thousands now?”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Boy.</span>—“It’s well you know what call I have. It’s well you know
it’s a lonesome thing to be passing small towns with the
lights shining sideways when the night is down, or going in
strange places with a dog noising before you and a dog noising
behind, or drawn to the cities where you’d hear a voice
kissing and talking deep love in every shadow of the ditch,
and you passing on with an empty stomach failing from your
heart.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick listened to the beautiful words and his eyes
glowed. The dusk was falling in the room, and half-lights
of gold and purple hovered over the fireplace and the gallery.
The leaves of the tree had changed from green to dark grey,
and, above them, where there had been two stars there were
now a million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And again,” said Lester, “listen to this.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Boy.</span>—“When the airs is warming in four months or five, it’s then
yourself and me should be pacing Neifin in the dews of
night, the time sweet smells do be rising, and you’d see a
little shiny new moon, maybe, sinking on the hills.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Girl.</span> (playfully).—“And it’s that kind of a poacher’s love you’d
make, Christy Mahon, on the sides of Neifin, when the night
is down?”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Boy.</span>—“It’s little you’ll think if my love’s a poacher’s or an earl’s
itself, when you’ll feel my two hands stretched around you,
and I squeezing kisses on your puckered lips, till I’d feel a
kind of pity for the Lord God in all ages sitting lonesome in
his golden chair.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Girl.</span>—“That’ll be right fun, Christy Mahon, and any girl would
walk her heart out before she’d meet a young man was your
like for eloquence or talk at all.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Boy</span> (encouraged).—“Let you wait, to hear me talking, till we’re
astray in Ennis, when Good Friday’s by, drinking a sup from
a well and making mighty kisses with our wetted mouths, or
gaming in a gap of sunshine, with yourself stretched back
unto your necklace, in the flowers of the earth.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Girl</span> (in a low voice moved by his tone).—“I’d be nice so, is it?”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>The Boy</span> (with rapture).—“If the mitred bishops seen you that time,
they’d be the like of the holy prophets, I’m thinking, do be
straining the bars of Paradise to lay eyes on the Lady Helen
of Troy, and she abroad, pacing back and forward, with a
nosegay in her golden shawl.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped, and sat, silently, with the book in front of
him. The half-light in the room spread into a circle of pale
rose-colour immediately round the window; the night sky
was of the deepest blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Maradick it was as though the place itself had spoken.
The colour of the day had taken voice and whispered to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said. “That’s very beautiful. Would
you lend it to me some time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted,” said Lester. “You can have it now if you
like. Take it with you. The whole play won’t keep you
more than half an hour. I have his other things, if you care
to look at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick went off to dress with the book under his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came down to the drawing-room he found Mrs.
Lester there alone. Only one lamp was lit and the curtains
were not drawn, so that the dusky sky glowed with all its
colours, blue and gold and red, beyond the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he saw Mrs. Lester he stopped for a moment at the
door. The lamplight fell on one cheek and some dark bands
of her hair, the rest of her face was in shadow. She smiled
when she saw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I’m so glad that you’ve come down before the
rest. I’ve been wanting to speak to you all day and there
has been no opportunity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your husband has been showing me a wonderful play by
that Irishman, Synge,” he said. “I hadn’t heard of him.
I had no idea——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “You’ve struck one of Fred’s pet hobbies,”
she said; “start him on Synge and he’ll never stop. It’s
nice for a time—at first, you know; but Synge for ever—well,
it’s like living on wafers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed and leaned back in her chair. She spoke in a
low voice, and it gave a note of intimacy to their conversation.
As she looked at him she thought again what a fine
man he was. Evening dress suited him, and the way that
he sat, leaning a little towards her with his head raised and
the lamplight falling on his chin and throat, gave her a little
thrill of pleasure. He was very big and strong, and she contrasted
him with her husband. Maradick would probably
be a bore to live with, whilst Fred, as a matter of fact, did
very well. But for playing a game this was the very man, if,
indeed, he knew that it was only a game; it would be a
dreadful nuisance if he took it seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long are you staying here?” she said. “We shall
stop for another fortnight, I suppose, unless my husband
suddenly takes it into his head to run away. Even then I
shall probably stay. I love the place; let me see—to-day’s
the fourteenth—yes, we shall probably be here until the
twenty-eighth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must get back when the month is up,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I hate to think of going back. I’m enjoying every
minute of it, but I don’t think my wife will be sorry. The
heat doesn’t suit her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope,” she bent forward a little and laid her hand on
his chair, “that you didn’t think it very impertinent of
me to speak as I did at the picnic the other day. I thought
afterwards that I had, perhaps, said too much. But then
I felt that you were different from most men, that you would
understand. I trust too much, I think, to intuition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please don’t think that,” he said eagerly. “We
have only got another fortnight here. Why shouldn’t we
be friends? I’m beginning to think that I have wasted too
much of my life by being afraid of going too far, of saying
the wrong thing. I have begun to understand life differently
since I have been here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether he implied that it was since he had known her
that he had begun to understand, she did not know; at any
rate she would take it for that. “There are so many things
that I could tell you,” she said. “I think you are to be
trusted. It is not often that a woman can feel that about
anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for saying that,” he said, looking her full in
the face; “I will try and deserve it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She touched his hand with hers and felt a delicious little
thrill, then she heard steps and moved to the fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale and Alice Du Cane came into the room, and it
was evident at once that they were upset. Lady Gale talked
to Maradick, but it was obvious that her mind was elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Tony been with you this afternoon?” she said.
“Alice says she saw him about four o’clock, but no one has
seen him since. He hasn’t come back, apparently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Maradick said, “I haven’t seen him since breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him for a moment, and he felt that her
look had something of reproach in it. He suddenly was
conscious that he was, in their eyes at any rate, responsible
for anything that Tony might do. He ought to have stood
guard. And, after all, where had the boy been? He should
have been back by now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is really too bad,” Lady Gale said. “He knows that
his father dislikes unpunctuality at meals above all things,
and he has been late again and again just lately. I must
speak to him. He’s later than ever to-night. Where did you
see him, Alice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down on the sand. But he didn’t see <span class='it'>me</span>.” She spoke
uneasily, and Maradick saw at once that she was keeping
something back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been going about with a Punch and Judy man
recently,” said Mrs. Lester. “I have nothing to say against
Punch and Judy men personally. I always want to stop in
the street and watch; but as a continual companion——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This particular one,” said Maradick, “is especially nice,
an awfully decent little fellow. I’ve talked to him several
times. No, Lady Gale, I’m afraid my wife isn’t well enough
to come down to-night. She’s had a bad headache all day.
It’s this heat, I think.” He looked at her rather as a guilty
schoolboy watches his master. He reproached himself for
having left the boy alone during the whole day, and he began
to be anxious on his own account. The situation was getting
too much for his nerves. For the first time he considered
Alice Du Cane. He had not thought of her as being very
actively concerned in the business, but there was something
in her face now that spoke of trouble. She was standing by
the lamp nervously fingering some books at her side. The
thought that she was in trouble touched him, and he began
to feel the burden of the situation still more heavily upon
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he knew at once what it was that was troubling Lady
Gale. It was Sir Richard. He had seen enough of that
Gentleman to know that so long as superficial things were all
right, so long as bells rang at the proper moment and everyone
immediately concerned with him were respectful and
decently dressed, he would ask no questions; but let him once
begin to have suspicions that something was lacking in respect
to himself and the family generally and nothing would
hinder his irritable curiosity. He had probably begun already
to ask questions about Tony. Here was a new element
of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened and everyone turned eagerly towards
it; it was Sir Richard and Rupert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert didn’t appear to be more concerned than was
usual with him, but Sir Richard was evidently annoyed.
He advanced into the room with his customary before-dinner
manner, that of one about to lead a cavalry regiment to the
charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s late,” he said; “late. Where’s Tony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the question that everyone had been expecting,
but no one answered it for a moment. Then Lady Gale got
up from her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be in in a minute, I expect,” she said. “He’s
been kept. But it’s no use waiting for dinner. I suppose
Fred will be late, Millie? Never mind, we’ll go down.
You’ll dine with us, Mr. Maradick, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard led the way with ominous silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was quite full, and for a breathless, agitated
moment it seemed that their own table had been taken;
but the alarm was false, and everyone could breathe again.
Lady Gale’s life was spent in the endeavour to prevent her
husband from discovering a grievance. Let it once be discovered
and a horrible time was before her, for Sir Richard
petted it and nursed it until it grew, with a rapidity that was
outside nature, into a horrible monster whose every movement
caused the house to tremble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw them, those grievances, come creeping round the
corner and at once her hand was out and she held them,
strangled, in her grip, and the danger was averted. Tony
had often before been responsible for these agitations, but
she had always caught them in time; now, she realised it
as she crossed the dining-room, she was too late, and every
moment of Tony’s absence made matters worse. Sir Richard
looked at the menu, and then complained about it in monosyllables
for several minutes. Maradick watched the door
with nervous eyes. This intrusion of Sir Richard into the
business complicated things horribly. Let him once suspect
that Tony was carrying on an affair with some girl in the
town and the boy would at once be sent away; that, of course,
would mean the end of everything, for him as well as for
Tony. The Gales would go, the Lesters would go—everyone,
everything. Tony himself would not allow it to be left
at that, but, after all, what could he do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Du Cane was talking excitedly about nothing in
particular, Mrs. Lester was very quiet, Rupert, as usual, was
intent upon his food. Alice chattered at Mrs. Lester, “Lucy
Romanes was there; you know, that ridiculous girl with the
scraped back hair and the pink complexion. Oh! too absurd
for anything! You know Muriel Halliday said that she
simply spends her days in following Captain Fawcett round.
He rather likes it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the sort of man who would. I can’t
stand the girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester smiled across the table. “It’s old Mrs.
Romanes’s fault. She sends her round, she can’t get rid
of any of her girls anywhere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. five of them, poor things;
she’d sell any of them for twopence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard had finished his soup, and he leaned across
the table towards his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the boy doing?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Richard, I don’t know. He’s been out sailing,
I expect, and the wind or something has kept him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t have it”; he glowered at everyone. “He knows
when meals are, he must be here. I must have obedience;
and now I come to think of it”—he paused and looked round
the table—“it has happened often lately. It hadn’t occurred
to me before, but I remember now; frequently—yes—late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after a pause during which no one said a word,
“What has he been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was so precisely the question that everyone else had
been asking carefully and surreptitiously during the last few
days that everyone looked guilty, as though they had been
discovered in a crime. Then everyone turned to Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “I’ve been about with him a good deal lately,
Sir Richard. I really don’t know what we’ve done very
much beyond walking. But I think he was going to sail this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale looked anxiously at the waiter. If the food
were all right the danger might be averted. But of course
on this night of all nights everything was wrong: the potatoes
were hard, the peas harder, the meat was overdone. Sir
Richard glared at the waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask Mr. Bannister if he would spare me a minute,” he
said. Bannister appeared as spherical and red-cheeked as
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things are disgraceful to-night,” Sir Richard said. “I
must beg you, Mr. Bannister, to see to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bannister was gently apologetic. The cook should be
spoken to, it was abominable; meanwhile was there anything
that he could get for Sir Richard? No? He was sorry.
He bowed to the ladies and withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s abominable—this kind of thing. And Tony?
Why, it’s quarter to nine; what does he mean? It’s always
happening. Are these people he knows in the town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t know, dear. I expect that he’s met people
down there; it’s probable. But I shouldn’t worry, dear.
I’ll speak to him.” She looked across at Alice. “What
were you saying about Mrs. Romanes, dear? I used to know
her a long while ago; I don’t suppose she would remember me
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick had a miserable feeling that she blamed him for
all this. If he had only looked after Tony and stayed with
him this would never have happened. But he couldn’t be
expected to stay with Tony always. After all, the boy was
old enough to look after himself; it was absurd. Only, just
now perhaps it would have been wiser. He saw that Mrs.
Lester was smiling. She was probably amused at the whole
affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly at the farther end of the room some one came
in. It was Tony. Maradick held his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked so perfectly charming as he stood there, recognising,
with a kind of sure confidence, the “touch” that
was necessary to carry the situation through. He could see,
of course, that it <span class='it'>was</span> a situation, but whether he recognised
the finer shades of everyone’s feeling about it—the separate,
individual way that they were all taking it, so that Alice’s
point of view and his mother’s point of view and Maradick’s
point of view were all, really, at the opposite ends of the pole
as far as seeing the thing went—that was really the important
question. They all were needing the most delicate handling,
and, in fact, from this moment onwards the “fat” was most
hopelessly in the fire and the whole business was rolling “tub-wise”
down ever so many sharp and precipitous hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stood there, looking down at them, most radiantly
happy. His hair was still wet from his bath, and his tie was
a little out of place because he had dressed in a hurry, and he
smiled at them all, taking them, as it were, into his heart
and scolding them for being so foolishly inquisitive, and,
after it all, letting them no further into his confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew, of course, exactly how to treat his father; his
mother was more difficult, but he could leave her until afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Sir Richard’s indignant “Well?” he answered politely,
but with a smile and a certain hurried breathlessness to show
that he had taken trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, I’m awfully sorry.” He sat down and turned,
with a smile, to the company. “I’m afraid I’m dreadfully
late, but it was ever so much later than I’d thought. I was
most awfully surprised when I saw the clock upstairs. I’ve
smashed my own watch. You remember, mother, my dropping
it when we were down in the town. Tuesday, wasn’t
it? Yes, I’ll have soup, please. I say, I hope you people
won’t mind; I suppose you’ve about finished, but I’m going
right through everything. I’m just as hungry as I can jolly
well be. No, no sherry, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sir Richard’s solemnity was imperturbable. “Where
have you been?” he said coldly. “You know how strongly
I dislike unpunctuality at meal-times, yes, unpunctuality.
And this is not only unpunctuality, it is positively missing it
altogether; I demand an explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This public scolding before all the assembled company
seemed to Maradick in very bad taste, and he shifted uneasily
in his chair, but Tony did not seem to mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he said, looking up from his soup and smiling
at his father, “I am most awfully careless. But it wasn’t
all that, as a matter of fact. I rowed round the Point to
Boulter’s Cove, and the tides are most awfully dicky and they
played old Harry with us this evening, I simply couldn’t get
along at all. It was like rowing against a wall. I knew it
was most beastly late, but I couldn’t get any faster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Us?” said Sir Richard. “Who were your companions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a slight movement round the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Tony easily, “there are all sorts of old sailor
Johnnies down there that one gets to know, and they’re awfully
good sorts. There’s one fellow about eight foot and
broad in proportion; the girls are simply mad about him,
they——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lady Gale interrupted him. “You’d better be getting
on with your meal, dear. It’s late. I don’t think we
need wait. Shall we have coffee outside?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t you people wait,” said Tony, “I’ll come along
in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Alice turned to go she stopped for a moment by his
chair. “I saw you this afternoon,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! <span class='it'>did</span> you?” he answered, looking up at her. For a
moment he seemed disturbed, then he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where and when?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This afternoon, somewhere after four; you were on the
beach.” She looked at him for a moment, standing very
straight and her head flung back. “I am glad you enjoyed
your row,” she said with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must talk to Maradick about it,” he said to himself.
He was quite prepared for complications; of course, there
were bound to be in such a situation. But at present the
memory of the wonderful afternoon enwrapped him like a
fire, so that he could not think of anything else, he could
not see anything but her eyes and smile and golden hair.
The empty room hung before his eyes, with the white cloths
on innumerable tables gleaming like white pools in rows
across the floor, and dark mysterious men, who might be perhaps,
at more brightly lighted times, waiters, moved silently
from place to place. But beyond, outside the room, there
shone the white curve of the boat stealing like a ghost across
the water, and behind it the dark band of hill, the green
clump of trees, the dusky, trembling figures of the sheep.
Oh! glorious hour!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little waiter, with a waistcoat that was far too large for
him and a tie that had crept towards his right ear, hung
in the background. Tony pushed his plate away and looked
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he said, “are you in love with anyone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter, who hailed from Walham Green, and, in spite
of his tender years, was burdened with five children and a
sick wife, coughed apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” he said, “to be strictly truthful, I can’t
say as I am, not just at present. And perhaps it’s just as
well, seeing as how I’ve been a married man these fifteen
years.” He folded a table-cloth carefully and coughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, isn’t it possible to be in love with your wife?”
asked Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter’s mind crept timidly back to a certain tea of
shrimps and buns on the Margate sands many, very many
years ago. He saw a red sun and a blue sky and some nigger
minstrels, white and black; but that was another lifetime
altogether, before there were children and doctor’s bills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” he said, “it gets kind o’ casual after a time;
not that it’s anyone’s fault exactly, only times ’is ’ard and
there’s the children and one thing and another, and there
scarcely seems time for sentiment exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He coughed his way apologetically back into the twilight
at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There scarcely seems time for sentiment exactly!”
Tony laughed to himself at the absurdity of it and stepped
out into the garden. He didn’t want to see the family just
at present. They would grate and jar. He could be alone;
later, he would talk to Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Lady Gale, for the first time in her life, avoided him.
She did not feel that she could talk to him just yet; she
must wait until she had thought out the new developments
and decided on a course of action. The day had filled her
with alarm, because suddenly two things had been shown to
her. The first, that there was no one in the world for whom
she really cared save Tony. There were other people whom
she liked, friends, acquaintances; for her own husband and
Rupert she had a protecting kindliness that was bound up
intimately in her feeling for the family, but love!—no—it
was Tony’s alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never realised before how deeply, how horribly
she cared. It was something almost wild and savage in her,
so that she, an old lady with white hair and a benevolent
manner, would have fought and killed and torn his enemies
were he in danger. The wildness, the ferocity of it frightened
her so that she sat there in the dark with trembling
hands, watching the lights of the ships at sea and, blindly,
blindly praying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had known, of course, before, that he was everything
to her, that without him life would lose all its purpose and
meaning and beauty, but there had been other things that
counted as well; now it seemed that nothing else mattered in
the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the second thing that she saw, and it was this second
revelation that had shown her the first, was that she was in
danger of losing him. The relationship of perfect confidence
that had, she fondly imagined, existed until now between
them, had never been endangered, because there had been
nothing to hide. He had not told her everything, of course;
there must have been things at Oxford, and even before, that
he had not told her, but she had felt no alarm because they had
been, she was sure, things that did not matter. And then he
had, so often, come and told her, told her with his charming
smile and those open eyes of his, so that there could be no
question of his keeping anything back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had studied the relationship of mother and son so
perfectly that she had had precisely the right “touch” with
him, never demanding what he was not ready to give, always
receiving the confidences that he handed her. But now for
the first time he was keeping things back, things that mattered.
When she had spoken so bravely to Maradick a fortnight
ago, on that day when she had first caught sight of the
possible danger, she had thought that she was strong enough
and wise enough to wait, patiently, with perfect trust. But
it was not possible, it could not be done. She could not sit
there, with her hands folded, whilst some strange woman
down there in that dark, mysterious town caught her boy away
from her. Every day her alarm had grown; she had noticed,
too, that their relationship had changed. It had been so
wonderful and beautiful, so delicate and tender, that any
alteration in its colour was at once apparent to her. He
had not been so frank, there had been even a little artificiality
in his conversations with her. It was more than she could
bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, although the uncertainty of it might kill her, she
must not know. She saw that as clearly, as inevitably as
ever. Let her once know, from his own confession, that he
loved some girl down there in the town, and she would be
forced to stop it. The horizon would widen, and bigger,
louder issues than their own personal feelings would be concerned.
The family would be called into the issue, and
she could not be false to its claims. She could not be untrue
to her husband and all the traditions. And yet it was
only Tony’s happiness that she cared for; that must be considered
above everything else. Maradick would know
whether this girl were, so to speak, “all right.” If she were
impossible, then he assuredly would have stopped it by now.
Maradick was, in fact, the only clue to the business that she
had got.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was partly because she was losing her trust in him
that she was unhappy now. His guard over Tony had, for
to-day at any rate, been miserably inadequate. He might
feel, perhaps, that he had no right to spend his time in hanging
on to Tony’s coat-tails, it wasn’t fair on the boy, but he
ought to have been with him more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting now with Alice on the seat at the farther
end of the garden overlooking the town. The place seemed
hateful to her, as she stared down it acquired a personality
of its own, a horrible menacing personality. It lay there with
its dark curved back like some horrible animal, and the
lights in the harbours were its eyes twinkling maliciously; she
shuddered and leant back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you cold, dear?” It was the first time that Alice
had spoken since they had come out. She herself was
sitting straight with her head back, a slim white figure like
a ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s stiflingly warm, as a matter of fact. I was
thinking, and that’s about the only thing that an old woman
can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are worried.” Alice spoke almost sharply. “And
I hate you to be worried. I’ve noticed during these last few
days——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose I am a little,” Lady Gale sighed. “But
then you’ve been worried too, dear, for the matter of that.
It hasn’t been altogether a success, this place, this time.
I don’t know what’s been wrong exactly, because the
weather’s been beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice put her hand on Lady Gale’s. “You won’t think
me an utter pig, will you, dear, if I go up to Scotland at
the end of the week? I think I had better, really. I’m not
well down here, and it only makes it uncomfortable for the
rest of you if I’m cross and absurd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale sighed. “If you really want to go, dear,”
she said, “of course you must. Do just what you like.
Only, I shall miss you badly. You’re a great help to me, you
know. Of course there’s Milly, but she’s been funny lately.
She always gets excited down here.” Lady Gale put her
arm round the girl. “Stay for a little, dear. I want you.
We all want you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice drew herself up for a moment as though she would
repel the caress; then she tried to say something, but the
words would not come. With a little cry she buried her face
in the other’s dress. For a few moments there was silence,
then her shoulders heaved and she burst into passionate sobbing.
Lady Gale said nothing—only, with her hand, she
stroked her hair. The night was very still, so still that they
could hear coming up from the town the distant chorus of
some song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Alice raised her head. “Please,” she said, “don’t
worry about me.” But she clutched Lady Gale’s hand.
“Oh! I’m ashamed of myself. I’m a fool to give way like
this.” She suddenly drew her hand fiercely away. But
Lady Gale took it in hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” she said, “I have been wanting you to speak to
me all this time, and you wouldn’t; of course I knew what
the matter was, you can’t keep that from his mother. We
all seem to have been at cross-purposes, as it is in a play,
when one word would put everything right, but everybody
is afraid to say it. Why, I want to talk to you about it all.
Do you suppose that I am not having a bad time too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice leaned towards her and kissed her. “I’m sorry,”
she said, “I’ve been so selfish lately. I haven’t thought
about anyone else. I hadn’t realised what you must feel
about it. I ought to have known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped for a moment, then she went on speaking in
little gasps as though she had been running. “But I hadn’t
meant to speak at all anything about it. I hate myself for
having given way. I, who had always prided myself on my
restraint and self-possession, to cry like a child for the moon.”
She shrugged her shoulders and laughed bitterly. “I won’t
give way again,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale put her arm round her and drew her close.
“Alice, dear, let me talk to you for a moment. You are
going through a bad time, and it may be a crisis and alter
your whole life. You are very young, my dear, and I am so
old that I seem to have been through everything and to know
it all from the beginning. So perhaps I can help you. I
love you from the bottom of my heart, and this thing has
drawn us together as nothing else in the world possibly
could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice pressed close against her. “Oh! I’ve been so lonely
these last days, you can’t know how bad it has been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, of course I know. I saw at once when we
came down here that something was wrong. I wanted to
talk to you, but it’s no use forcing people’s confidence. I
knew that you’d speak to me if you wanted to. But we’re
together in this, we both love Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I’m ashamed.” Alice spoke very low, it was almost
a whisper. “And yet, do you know, in a way I’m glad.
It showed me that I’ve got something that I was almost
afraid wasn’t in me at all. In spite of my pride I have
been sometimes suddenly frightened, and wondered whether
it were really in me to care for anyone at all. And then all
in a moment this has come. I would die for Tony; I would
let him trample on me, kill me, beat me. Sometimes, when
we are sitting, all of us, so quietly there in the drawing-room
or in the garden, and he talking, oh, I want to get up
and fling myself at him and hold him there before them all.
I have been afraid during these last few days that I shall
suddenly lose control. I have wondered once or twice
whether I am not going mad. Now you see why I must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale bent over her. “Alice dear, I understand, of
course I understand. But let me try and show you, dear,
why you must stay. Just for this next week or two. You
can be of so much help to me and to Tony. I have been
having rather a bad time too. It is like walking in the
dark with things on every side of you that you cannot see.
And I want you, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice did not speak. The bells in the distant town struck
ten, first one and then another and then five or six at once.
Five lights of boats at sea gleamed in a row like stars that
had fallen into the water, through the dark mist of the
trees a curved moon sailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, dear, things are so difficult now, and they
seem to grow worse every day. And really it comes to
this. You and I and Mr. Maradick all love Tony. The
others don’t count. Of course I’m not sure about Mr.
Maradick, but I think he cares very much in his own way,
and so we are, you see, a bodyguard for him. I mean to do
as he wants to. Tony has always seen things perfectly
clearly and has known what he wanted, but now there are
other things that make it harder for him. I hoped when
we came down here that he was going to marry you, dear,
but perhaps after all it is better that he shouldn’t. The only
thing that matters in the least in this world is love, getting
it and keeping it; and if a man or a woman have secured
that, there is nothing else that is of any importance. And
so I always determined that Tony should have his own choice,
that he should go when he wished to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused and took Alice’s hand and stroked it. “This
is the first time that he has ever really been in love. Of
course I know—I knew at once by the light in his eyes—and
I want him to have it and to keep it and, whatever happens,
not to miss it. But of course I must not know about it,
because then his father would have to be told. Sir Richard
thinks a great deal of the family. It is the only thing that
matters to him very much. And of course there would be
terrible scenes and I should have to go with the family.
So, whatever happens, I must not know about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Alice, “I see that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so, you see, I put Mr. Maradick there as a guard.
He is a worthy creature, a little dull, but very trustworthy,
and I knew that he would do his best. But it is harder than
I had thought it would be. Now Sir Richard is beginning
to wonder where Tony goes, and I am afraid that in a day
or two there will be some terrible scene and Tony will go,
perhaps for ever. So I want you to be with me here. You
can talk to Mr. Maradick, and if I see that you are satisfied
then I shall know that it is all right. It will make all the
difference in the world if I have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are asking rather a lot,” Alice said. “I don’t think
you quite realise what it is to me. It is like some strange
spell, and if I were fanciful or absurd I should imagine that
the place had something to do with it. Of course it hasn’t,
but I feel as if I should be my normal self again if I could
once get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You’ll never be quite the same person again. One
never can get back. But look at it in this way, dear. Do
you care enough for Tony to be of real help to him, to do
something for him that no one else can possibly do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I care for him?” Alice laughed. “I care for him
as no one has ever cared for anyone before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! That’s what we all think, my dear. I thought
that once about Sir Richard. But you can do everything
for him now, if you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alice shrugged her shoulders. “As far as I understand
it,” she said, “you want me to spy on Mr. Maradick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not to spy, of course not. Only to behave to Tony
as if nothing had happened, and to help me about Sir
Richard. And then you can talk to Mr. Maradick, if you
like; ask him right out about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then he’ll say, and quite rightly too, that it’s none
of my business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is. It’s all our business. A thing like that
can’t happen to anybody without its interfering, like a stone
and a pool, with everything around it. Of course it’s your
business, yours more than anybody’s. And really, dear, I
don’t think you’ll make things any better by going away.
Things seem far worse when you’ve got to look over ever so
many counties to see them at all. Stay here with Tony and
live it down. It will pass, like the measles or anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused. Then she suddenly put her arms round the
girl and held her close. “I want you, I want you, dear.
I am very miserable. I feel that I am losing Tony, perhaps
for always. He will never be the same again, and I can’t
bear it. He has always been the centre of everything, always.
I scarcely know how I could have faced some things
if it hadn’t been for him. And now I’ve got to face them
alone; but if you are here with me I shan’t be alone after
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Alice let her face rest in Lady Gale’s dress and she
promised. There was, as it happened, more in her promise
than mere acquiescence. She had her own curiosity as to
the way it was all going to turn out, and perhaps, deep
in her heart, a hope that this girl down in the town would
be nothing after all, and that Tony would return, when the
two or three weeks were over, to his senses. But the real
temptation that attacked her was terribly severe. It would
be fatally easy to talk to Sir Richard, and, without saying
anything either definite or circumstantial, to put him unmistakably
on the track. The immediate issue would, of
course, be instant marching orders for everybody, and that
would be the last that Tony would see of his rustic. Her
thoughts lingered around the girl. What was she like, she
wondered? Coarse, with a face of beetroot red and flaxen
hair; no, Tony had taste, he would know what to choose.
She was probably pretty. Wild and uncouth, perhaps; that
would be likely to catch him. And now she, Alice Du Cane,
must stand quietly by and play the part of platonic friend.
What fun life must be for the gods who had time to watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Tony had found Maradick in a deserted corner
of the garden and had poured the afternoon’s history into
his ears. It was a complete manual on the way to make love,
and it came out in a stream of uninterrupted eloquence, with
much repetition and a continual impulse to hark back to the
central incident of the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, at last, I told her!” A small bird in a
nest above their heads woke for a moment and felt a little
thrill of sympathy. “By heaven, Maradick, old man, I
had never lived until then. She and I were swept into
Paradise together, and for a moment earth had gone, rolled
away, vanished; I can’t talk about it, I can’t really. But
there we were on the sand with the sea and the sky! Oh,
my word! I can’t make you feel it, only now I am hers
always and she is mine. I am her slave, her knight. One
always used to think, you know, that all the stuff men and
women put about it in books was rot and dreadfully dull
at that, but now it all seems different. Poetry, music, all
the things that one loved, are different now. They are new,
wonderful, divine! and there we were in the boat, you know,
just drifting anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick played audience to this enthusiasm with a somewhat
melancholy patience. He had felt like that once about
Mrs. Maradick. How absurd! He saw her as he had seen
her last with the bed-clothes gathered about her in a scornful
heap and her eyes half closed but flashing fire. She had
refused to speak to him! And he had kissed her once and
felt like Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but a fellow can’t talk about it. Only, one thing,
Maradick, that struck me as awfully funny, the way that
she accepted everything. When I told her about my people,
of course I expected her to be awfully disappointed. But
she seemed to understand at once and accepted it as the
natural thing. So that if it comes to running away she is
quite prepared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it comes to running away!” The words at once
brought the whole situation to a point, and Maradick’s responsibility
hit him in the face like a sudden blow from the
dark. For a moment fear caught him by the throat; he
wanted, wildly, to fling off the whole thing, to catch the
next train back to Epsom, to get away from this strange
place that was dragging him, as it were, with a ghostly
finger, into a whirlpool, a quagmire; anything was treacherous
and dangerous and destructive. And then he knew,
in the next instant, that though he might go back to Epsom
and his office and all the drudgery of it, he would never be
the same man again, he could never be the same man again.
He knew now that the only thing in the world worth having
was love—this town had shown him that—and that, for it,
all the other things must go. This boy had found it and he
must help him to keep it. He, Maradick, had found it;
there were friends of his here—Tony, Mrs. Lester—and he
couldn’t go back to the loneliness of his old life with the
memory of these weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he gripped Tony’s arm, “I don’t suppose
I ought to have anything to do with it. Any man in his
senses would tell your people, and there’d be an end of the
whole thing; but I gave you my word before and I’ll go on
with it. Besides, I’ve seen the girl. I’d fall in love with
her myself, Tony, if I were your age, and I don’t want you
to miss it all and make a damned muddle of your life just
because you weren’t brave enough or because there wasn’t
anyone to help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, Maradick, you’re a brick. I can’t tell you
how I feel about it, about her and you and everything, a
chap hasn’t got words; only, of course, it’s going forward.
You see, you couldn’t tell my people after all that you’ve
done—you wouldn’t, you know; and as I’d go on whether
you left me or no you may just as well help me. And
then I’m awfully fond of you; I like you better than I’ve
ever liked any man, you’re such an understanding fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony took breath a moment. Then he went on—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mater’s really the only thing that matters, and
if I wasn’t so jolly sure that she’d like Janet awfully, and
really would want me to carry the thing through, I wouldn’t
do it at all. But loving Janet as I do has made me know
how much the mater is to me. You know, Maradick, it’s
jolly odd, but there are little things about one’s mater that
stick in one’s mind far more than anything else. Little
things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but she’s always been just everything, and there
are lots of blackguards, I know, feel just the same .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
so it sort of hurts going on playing this game and not telling
her about it. It’s the first thing I’ve not told her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
it will be all right when it’s over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other people,” said Maradick; “your
father——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the governor! Yes, he’s beginning to smell a rat,
and he’s tremendous once he’s on the track, and that all
means that it’s got to be done jolly quickly. Besides, there’s
Alice Du Cane; she saw us, Janet and me, on the beach this
afternoon, and there’s no knowing how long she’ll keep her
tongue. No, I’ll go and see Morelli to-morrow and ask him
right off. I went back with her to-night, and he was most
awfully friendly, although he must have had pretty shrewd
suspicions. He likes me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you be too sure about him,” said Maradick; “I
don’t half like it. I don’t trust him a yard. But see here,
Tony, come and see me at once to-morrow after you’ve
spoken to him, and then we’ll know what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned to him and put his hand on his shoulder.
“I say. I don’t know why you’re such a brick to me. I’ll
never forget it”; and then suddenly he turned up the path
and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick climbed the dark stairs to his room. His wife
was in bed, asleep. He undressed quietly; for an instant
he looked at her with the candle in his hand. She looked
very young with her hair lying in a cloud about the pillow;
he half bent down as though he would kiss her. Then he
checked himself and blew out the candle.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MORE OF THE ITINERANT OPTIMIST; ALICE DU CANE</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>ASKS MARADICK A FAVOUR</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick awoke very early on the next morning. As
he lay in his bed, his mind was still covered with the
cobwebs of his dreams, and he saw the room in a fantastic,
grotesque shape, so that he was not sure that it was his
room at all, but he thought that it might be some sea with
the tables and chairs for rocks, or some bare windy moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain blew ever so slightly in the wind from the
crevice of the door, and he watched it from his bed as it
swelled and bulged and shrunk back as though it were longing
to break away from the door altogether but had not
quite courage enough. But although he was still confused
and vague with the lazy bewilderment of sleep, he realised
quite definitely in the back of his mind that there was some
fact waiting for him until he should be clear-headed enough
to recognise it. This certainty of something definite before
him that had to be met and considered roused him. He did
not, in the least, know what that something was that awaited
him, but he tried to pull himself together. The sea receded,
the beating of its waves was very faint in his ears, and the
rocks resolved into the shining glass of the dressing-table and
the solemn chairs with their backs set resolutely against the
wall, and their expressions those of self-conscious virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes; he knew with
absolute certainty that he should not sleep again. The light
was trying to pierce the blind and little eyes of colour
winked at him from the window, the silver things on the
dressing-table stood out, pools of white, against the dark
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got out of bed, and suddenly the fact stared him in the
face: it was that he was committed, irrevocably committed,
to help Tony. He had, in a way, been committed before,
ever since Lady Gale asked him for his help; but there had
always been a chance of escaping, the possibility, indeed, of
the “thing” never coming off at all. But now it was coming
off, and very soon, and he had to help it to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had turned the whole situation over in his mind so
very often, and looked at it from so very many points of view,
with its absurdities and its tragedies and its moralities,
that there was nothing more to be said about the actual thing
at all; that was, in all conscience, concrete enough. He saw
it, as he sat on the bed swinging his feet, there in front of
him, as some actual personality with whom he had pledged
himself in league. He had sworn to help two children to
elope against everybody’s wishes—he, Maradick, of all people
the most law-abiding. What had come over him? However,
there it was and there was nothing more to be said about
it. It wasn’t to be looked at again at all with any view of its
possible difficulties and dangers, it had just to be carried
through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he knew, as he thought about it, that the issue was
really much larger than the actual elopement. It was the
effect on him that really mattered, the fact that he could
never return to Epsom again with any hope of being able to
live the life there that he had lived before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole circle of them would be changed by this; it
was the most momentous event in all their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked again at the morning. The mists were
rising higher in the air, and all the colours, the pale golden
sand, the red roofs, the brown bend of the rocks, were
gleaming in the sun. He would go and bathe and then search
out Punch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a quarter past five as he passed down the stairs;
the house was in the most perfect stillness, and only the
ticking of innumerable clocks broke the silence. Suddenly
a bird called from the garden; a little breath of wind, bringing
with it the scent of pinks and roses, trembled through
the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he reached the cove the sea was like glass. He
had never bathed early in the morning before, and a few
weeks ago he would have laughed at the idea. A man of
his age bathing at half-past five in the morning! The water
would be terribly cold. But it wasn’t. He thought that
he had never known anything so warm and caressing as he
lay back in it and looked up through the clear green. There
was perfect silence. Things came into his mind, some operas
that he had heard, rather reluctantly, that year in London.
The opening of the third act of Puccini’s “Tosca,” with the
bell-music and the light breaking over the city. He remembered
that he had thought that rather fine at the time. The
lovers in “Louise” on Montmartre watching the lights burst
the flowers below them and saluting “Paris!” He had
appreciated that too. A scene in “To Paradise,” with a
man somewhere alone in a strange city watching the people
hurrying past him and counting the lamps that swung, a
golden chain, down the street. Some picture in the Academy
of that year, Sim’s “Night Piece to Julia.” He hadn’t
understood it or seen anything in it at the time. “One of
those new fellows who just stick the paint on anyhow,” he
had remarked; but now he seemed to remember a wonderful
blue dress and a white peacock in the background!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How funny it was, he thought, as he plunged, dripping,
back on to the beach, that the things that a fellow scarcely
noticed at all at the time should be just the things that
came into his mind afterwards. And on the sand he saw
Toby, the dog, gravely watching him. Toby came courteously
towards him, sniffed delicately at his socks, and then,
having decided apparently that they were the right kind of
socks and couldn’t really be improved on, sat down with his
head against Maradick’s leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick tickled his head and decided that pugs weren’t
nearly so ugly as he had thought they were. But then there
was a world of difference between Toby and the ordinary
pug, the fat pug nestling in cushions on an old lady’s lap,
the aristocratic pug staring haughtily from the soft luxury
of a lordly brougham, the town pug, over-fed, over-dressed,
over-washed. But Toby knew the road, he had seen the
world, he was a dog of the drama, a dog of romance; he was
also a dog with a sense of humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He licked Maradick’s bare leg with a very warm tongue
and then put a paw on to his arm. They were friends.
He ratified the contract by rolling over several times on
the sand; he then lay on his back with his four paws suspended
rigidly in the air, and then, catching sight of his
master, turned rapidly over and went to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch expressed no surprise at finding Maradick there at
that hour of the morning. It was the most natural thing in
the world. People who came to Treliss were always doing
things like that, and they generally spent the rest of their
lives in trying to forget that they had done them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been wanting to see you, Mr. Maradick, sir,” he
said, “and I’m mighty glad to find you here when there’s
nothing to catch our words save the sea, and that never tells
tales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as a matter of fact, Garrick,” said Maradick, “I
came down after you. I meant to have gone up to your
rooms after bathing, but as you are here it’s all the better.
I badly want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch sat down on the sand and looked quite absurdly like
his dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to talk to you about Morelli, Garrick.” Maradick
hesitated a moment. It was very difficult to put into
words exactly what he wanted to say. “We have talked
about the man before, and I shouldn’t bother you about it
again were it not that I’m very fond of young Tony Gale,
and he, as you know, has fallen in love with Morelli’s
daughter. It’s all a long story, but the main point is, that
I want to know as much about the man as you can tell me.
Nobody here seems to know very much about him except
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch’s brow had clouded at the mention of Morelli’s
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t rightly know,” he said, “as I can say anything
very definite, and that being so perhaps one oughtn’t to say
anything at all; but if young Gale’s going to take that girl
away, then I’m glad. He’s a good fellow, and she’s on my
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps after all it’s best to tell what I know.”
Punch took out a pipe and slowly filled it. “Mind you, it’s
all damned uncertain, a lot of little things that don’t mean
anything when taken by themselves. I first met the man in
’89, twenty years ago. I was a young chap, twenty-one or
so. A kind of travelling blacksmith I used to be then, with
Pendragon up the coast as a kind o’ centre. It was at
Pendragon I saw him. He used to live there then as he lives
in Treliss now; it was a very different kind o’ place then to
what it is now—just a sleepy, dreamy little town, with bad
lights, bad roads and the rest, and old tumbled down ’ouses.
Old Sir Jeremy Trojan ’ad the run of it then, him that’s
father of the present Sir Henry, and you wouldn’t have found
a quieter place, or a wilder in some ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wild?” said Maradick. “It’s anything but wild now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they’ve changed it with their trams and things, and
they’ve pulled down the cove; but the fisher-folk were a fierce
lot and they wouldn’t stand anyone from outside. Morelli
lived there with his wife and little girl. ’Is wife was only a
young thing, but beautiful, with great eyes like the sea on
a blue day and with some foreign blood in ’er, dark and
pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’E wasn’t liked there any more than ’e is here. They
told funny tales about him even then, and said ’e did things
to his wife, they used to hear her crying. And they said
that ’e’d always been there, years back, just the same, never
looking any different, and it’s true enough he looks just
the same now as he did then. It isn’t natural for a man
never to grow any older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Maradick, “it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were other things that the men down there didn’t
like about ’im, and the women hated ’im. But whenever
you saw ’im he was charming—nice as ’e could be to me and
all of ’em. And he was clever, could do things with his
’ands, and make birds and beasts do anything at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s strange,” said Maradick. “Tony said something
of the same sort the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that ain’t canny,” said David, “more especially
as I’ve seen other animals simply shake with fear when he
comes near them. Well, I was telling you, they didn’t like
’im down in the cove, and they’d say nothing to ’im and leave
’im alone. And then one night”—Punch’s mouth grew set
and hard—“they found Mrs. Morelli up on the moor lying
by the Four Stones, dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead!” said Maradick, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it was winter time and the snow blowing in great
sheets across the moor and drifting about her dress, with the
moon, like a yellow candle, hanging over ’er. But that
weren’t all. She’d been killed, murdered. There were
marks on her face and hands, as though teeth had torn her.
Poor creature!” Punch paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Maradick excitedly, “what was the end of
it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! they never brought it ’ome to anyone. I ’ad my
own thoughts, and the men about there kind o’ talked about
Morelli, but it was proved ’e was somewhere else when it
’appened and ’e cried like a child when ’e saw the body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Maradick, laughing, “so far it isn’t very
definite. That might have happened to any man.” But
it was, nevertheless, curiously in keeping with the picture
that he had in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Punch, “I told you already that I ’adn’t
got anything very definite. I don’t say as ’e did it or had
anything to do with it, but it’s all of a piece in a way.
Thing got ’ot against ’im in Pendragon after that and ’e
’ad to go, and ’e came ’ere with ’is girl. But they say that
’e’s been seen there since, and in other places too. And then
I’ve seen ’im do other things. Kill rabbits and birds like a
devil. ’E’s cruel, and then again ’e’s kind, just like a child
will pull flies to bits. ’E <span class='it'>is</span> just like a child, and so ’e isn’t
to be trusted. ’E’s wild, like Nature. ’E likes to have
young things about ’im. That’s why ’e’s taken to young
Gale, and ’e loves that girl in a way, although I know ’e’s
cruel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cruel to her?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ’e beats her, I know. I’ve been watching a long
way back; and then again ’e’ll kiss ’er and give ’er things and
play with ’er, and then one day ’e’ll kill ’er.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick started again. “Kill her?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. ’E’ll do anything when ’e’s mad. And a minute
after ’e’ll be sobbing and crying for sorrow over what ’e’s
hurt; and be like a drunkard when ’e’s angry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what do you make of it all?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make of it?” said Punch. “I don’t know. There
ain’t another like ’im in the kingdom. There’s more in
the world than folk ’ave any idea of, especially those that
keep to towns. But it’s out on the road that you’ll be seeing
things, when the moon is up and the hedges purple in their
shadows. And ’e belongs to all of that. ’E’s like Nature in
a way, cruel and kind and wild. ’E’s not to be believed in
by sober folks who laugh at spirits, but there’s more in it
than meets the eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was all that Maradick got from him; and after
all it did not amount to very much except a vague warning.
But there was this definite fact, that Janet was in danger
where she was, and that was an added impulse, of course,
for going on with the whole adventure. To the initial charm
of helping a delightful boy was now added the romantic
sensation of the release of a captive lady; Maradick, knight!
Forty and married for a lifetime; oh! the absurd world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Maradick went up for breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick’s first thought in the morning was her
hair, and then, at some considerable distance, the girls.
It never happened that they were both “right” simultaneously,
and she would indeed have been considerably surprised
and felt a certain lack if there had been no cause for complaint
on either score.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the present morning everything was as it should be.
Her hair “settled itself” as though by magic, the girls had
given no possible cause of complaint; she came down to
breakfast with an air of surprise and the kind of mind that
is quite sure something unpleasant is going to happen simply
because nothing unpleasant <span class='it'>has</span> “happened” so far. She
presented, as she came down the hotel staircase, a delightful
picture of neat compact charm; her girls, in precise and
maidenly attendance behind her, accentuated her short
stature by their own rather raw, long-legged size, but there
was nothing loose or uncouth about her. In her colouring,
in her light carnation silk waistband, in her high-heeled
shiny shoes, she was neatness personified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the eyes of everyone except Mrs. Lawrence she had
perhaps just a little too much the air of being “somebody,”
because really, of course, she was nothing at all, simply Mrs.
Maradick of Epsom; but then when you were so small
you had to do something to make up for it, and an “air”
did help undoubtedly. Her husband, coming in from the
garden, met her at the bottom of the stairs, and she treated
him very graciously. He kissed the girls with a “Well,
Lucy!” and “Well, Annie!” and then Mrs. Maradick, with
a final feeling for her hair and a last pat to the carnation
riband, led the way in to breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appeared that she was inclined to treat him graciously,
but in reality she was trying to make up her mind; she
was not a clever woman, and she had never been so puzzled
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, indeed, never been forced to puzzle about anything
at all. In her orderly compact life things had always
been presented to her with a decency and certainty that left
no room for question or argument. She had been quiet and
obedient at home, but she had always had her way; she had
married the man that had been presented to her without any
hesitation at all, it was a “good match,” and it meant that,
for the rest of her life, she would never be forced to ask any
questions about anything or anybody. For a wild week or
two, at first, she had felt strange undisciplined sensations
that were undoubtedly dangerous; on their wedding night she
had suddenly suspected that there was another woman there
whose existence meant storm and disorder. But the morning
had come with bills and calls and “finding a house,” and that
other Mrs. Maradick had died. From that day to this there
had been no cause for alarm. James had soon been reduced
to order and had become a kind of necessity, like the sideboard;
he paid the bills. Child-birth had been alarming for
a moment, but Mrs. Maradick had always been healthy and
they had an excellent doctor, but, after Annie’s appearance,
she had decided that there should never be another. James
presented no difficulties at all, and her only real worry in life
was her “hair.” There was not very much of it, and she
spent her mornings and her temper in devising plans whereby
it should be made to seem “a lot,” but it never was satisfactory.
Her “hair” became the centre of her life, her
horizon. James fitted into it. If the “hair” were all
right, he didn’t seem so bad. Otherwise he was stupid, dull,
an oaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she had come down to Treliss and life had suddenly
changed. It had really changed from that first evening
of their arrival when he had been so rude to her, although
she had not realised it at the time. But the astonishing
thing was that he had kept it up. He had never kept anything
up before, and it was beginning to frighten her. At
first it had seemed to her merely conceit. His head had
been turned by these people, and when he got back to Epsom
and found that he wasn’t so wonderful after all, and that
the people there didn’t think of him at all except as her
husband, then he would find his place again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now she wasn’t so sure. She had not been asleep last
night when he came to bed. She had seen him bend over with
the candle in his hand, and the look in his eyes had frightened
her, frightened her horribly, so that she had lain awake
for hours afterwards, thinking, puzzling for the first time
in her life. During all these twenty years of their married
life he had been, she knew, absolutely faithful to her. She
had laughed at it sometimes, because it had seemed so absolutely
impossible that there should ever be anyone else. He
did not attract people in Epsom in the least; he had never
made any attempt to, and she had imagined him, poor fellow,
sometimes trying, and the miserable mess that he would make
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she had got to face the certainty that there
was some one else. She had seen it in his eyes last night,
and she knew that he would never have had the strength
to keep up the quarrel for nearly a fortnight unless some one
else had been there. She saw now a thousand things that
should have convinced her before, little things all culminating
in that horrible picnic a few days ago. It was as though,
she thought, he had come down to Treliss determined to find
somebody. She remembered him in the train, how pleasant
and agreeable he had been! He had arranged cushions for
her, got things for her, but the moment they had arrived!
Oh! this hateful town!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now she had got to act. She had woke early that
morning and had found that he was already gone. That
alone was quite enough to stir all her suspicions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps now he was down there in the town with some
one! Why should he get up at an unearthly hour unless
it were for something of the kind? He had always been a
very sound sleeper. At Epsom he would never have thought
of getting up before eight. Who was it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put aside, for a moment, her own feelings about him,
the curious way in which she was beginning to look at him.
The different side that he was presenting to her and the way
that she looked at it must wait until she had discovered
this woman, this woman! She clenched her little hands
and her eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! she would talk to her when she found her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His early escape that morning seemed to her a sign that
the “woman” was down in the town. She imagined an
obvious assignation, but otherwise she might have suspected
that it was Mrs. Lester. That, of course, she had suspected
from the day of the picnic, but it seemed to her difficult to
imagine that a woman of the world, as Mrs. Lester, to give
her her due, most obviously was, could see anything in her
hulk of a James; it would be much more probable if it were
some uncouth fisherwoman who knew, poor thing, no better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him now across the breakfast-table; his
red cheeks, his great nostrils “like a horse’s,” his enormous
hands, but it was not all hostility the look that she gave him.
There was a kind of dawning wonder and surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had their table by the window, and the sun beat
through on to the silver teapot and the ham and eggs. Annie
had refused porridge. No, she wasn’t hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have bathed, as I did, before breakfast,”
said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he’d bathed before breakfast, had he? She looked
across at him smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were up very early,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I slept badly.” They were down again, those
blinds! She saw him drop them down as though by magic.
He was playing his game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, next time you must wake me and I’ll come too,”
she said. His sense of humour was touched at the idea of
her coming down at five in the morning, but he said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knowledge, the increasing certainty that there was
something in it all, was choking her so that she found it exceedingly
difficult to eat. But that she should be baffled by
James was so incredible an idea that she concealed her rising
temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded gaily at Mrs. Lawrence, who swam towards
their table with outstretched hands and a blue scarf floating
like wings behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you generally have it upstairs, I thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know; but <span class='it'>such</span> a day, one couldn’t really .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I was awake ever so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But James has been
bathing. No, Lucy, sit still, dear, until we’ve finished.
Bathing before breakfast. I think I really must to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Epsom closed about the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was extremely nice to him throughout the meal, and
even hinted at their doing something, spending the day, “and
<span class='it'>such</span> a day.” It was a shame not to take advantage of the
weather “as a family.” Quite a new idea, indeed, but he
accepted it, and even began to suggest possible places. She
was baffled again, and, as the terrible prospect of a whole
day spent in James’s company, quite alone except for the
girls, pressed about her, became almost hysterical in her hurriedly
discovered reasons why, after all, it would never do.
But he smiled at her, and although he was quite ready to do
anything that she might suggest, it was a different kind of
agreeing from a week or two ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She retired from the breakfast-table baffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been watching the door of the breakfast-room
eagerly, and when he went out down into the garden he was
still looking for the same figure. There was no longer, there
could be no longer any disguise about the person, it was Mrs.
Lester beyond any possible question; but he <span class='it'>did</span> disguise the
reason. He wanted to talk to her, he liked to talk to her,
just as he liked to talk to any understanding person, quite
irrespective of sex. She had, of course, her atmosphere;
it had a great deal in common with the place and the weather
and the amazing riot of colour that the weather had brought.
He saw her always as she had been on that first day, primrose,
golden, in that dark dim drawing-room; but that he
should think of her in that way didn’t show him, as it should
have done, how the case was really beginning to lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had the “Play-boy” on his knee and the light swung,
as some great golden censor is swung before the High Altar,
in waves of scent and colour backwards and forwards before
him. He watched, looking eagerly down the sunlit path,
but she did not come, and the morning passed in its golden
silence and he was still alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t indeed until after lunch that things began to
move again, and then Tony came to him. He was in a glow
of pleasure and excitement; she had written to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was most awfully clever; she only wrote it after I
left last night and she hadn’t time to post it, of course, but
she gave it to the old apple-woman—you know, down by the
tower—and right under her father’s nose, and he hadn’t the
least idea, and I’ve written back because I mayn’t, perhaps,
get a word with her this afternoon, and old Morelli will be
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat on the edge of the stone wall, looking down at
the town and swinging his legs. The town was in a blaze
of sun, seen dimly through a haze of gold-dust. It hung
like a lamp against the blue sky, because the mist gathered
closely about its foundations, and only its roofs and pinnacles
seemed to swing in the shifting dazzling sun before
their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old apple-woman,” said Tony, “is simply ripping,
and I think she must have had an awfully sad life. I should
like to do something for her.” There were at least ten people
a day for whom he wanted to do something. “I asked
Bannister about her, but he wasn’t very interested; but that’s
because his smallest baby’s got whooping-cough. He told
me yesterday he simply whooped all night, and Mrs. Bannister
had to sit up with it, which pretty well rotted her
temper next day.” Tony paused with a consciousness that
he was wandering from the point. “Anyhow, here’s her
letter, Janet’s, I mean. I know she wouldn’t mind you seeing
it, because you are in it almost as much as I am.” He
held out the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Morelli see her give it to the apple-woman?” asked
Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she tells you in the letter. But he didn’t spot anything.
He’s such a funny beggar; he seems so smart sometimes,
and then other times he doesn’t see anything. Anyhow,
it doesn’t matter much, because I’m going to see him
now and tell him everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well; and then?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! he’ll agree, I know he will. And then I think
we’ll be married right at once; there’s no use in waiting,
you know, and there’s a little church right over by Strater
Cove, near the sea, a little tumbledown place with a parson
who’s an awful sportsman. He’s got five children and two
hundred a year, and—oh! where was I?—and then we’ll
just come back and tell them. They can’t do anything then,
you know, and father will get over it all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was so serene about it, swinging his legs there in
the sun, that Maradick could say nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if Morelli doesn’t take to the idea?” he ventured
at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! he!” said Tony. “Oh, he’s really most awfully
keen. You noticed how we got on. I took to him from the
first, there was something about him.” But he swung round
rather anxiously towards Maradick. “Why! do you think
he won’t?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure of him,” Maradick answered. “I never
have been. And then I was with Punch this morning and
he told me things about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things! What sort of things?” asked Tony rather incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, about the way that he treated his wife.” It was, after
all, Maradick reflected, extremely vague, nothing very much
that one could lay hands on. “I don’t like the man, and
I don’t for a minute think that he’s playing square with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tony smiled, a rather superior smile. After all, that
was Maradick’s way, to be pessimistic about things; it was
to do with his age. Middle-aged people were always cautious
and suspicious. For a moment he felt quite a distance
from Maradick, and something akin to the same feeling
made him stretch out his hand for Janet’s letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” he said rather awkwardly, “perhaps she
would rather that I didn’t show it to anyone, even you.”
He jumped down from the wall. “Well, I must be off.
It’s after three. I say, keep the family in the dark until I’m
back. They’re sure to ask. Now that Alice and father are
both beginning to think about it we shall fairly have to begin
the conspirator business.” He laughed in his jolly way
and stood in front of Maradick with a smile all over his face.
Suddenly he leant forward and put his hands on the other
man’s shoulders and shook him gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You silly old rotter, don’t look so sad about it, you don’t
know what fun it will all be. And you are the biggest brick
in the world, anyway. Janet and I will never forget you.”
He bent down lower. “I say, you’re not sick with me, are
you? Because, scold me like anything if I’ve done things.
I always am doing things, you know.” He turned round
and faced the shining path and the sky like glass. “I say!
Isn’t it topping? But I must be off. I’ll come at once and
tell you when I get back. But I’ll have to be in time for
dinner to-night or the governor will keep me to my room on
bread and water.” He was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick, looking back on it all afterwards, always saw
that moment as the beginning of the second act. The first
act, of course, had begun with that vision of Janet on the
stairs with the candle in her hand. That seemed a long
while ago now. Then had come all the other things, the
picnic, the swim, the talk with Mrs. Lester, Tony’s proposal,
his own talk with Punch that morning; all little things, but
all leading the situation inevitably towards its climax. But
they had all been in their way innocent, unoffending links
in the chain. Now there was something more serious in it
all, from that evening some other element mingled with the
comedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly felt irritated with the sun and the colour
and began to walk up and down the path. The uneasiness
that he had felt all the afternoon increased; he began to wish
that he had not allowed Tony to go down alone. Nothing,
of course, could happen to the boy; it was absurd that he
should imagine things, and probably it was due to the heat.
Every now and again some sound came up from the town—a
cry, a bell, the noisy rattle of a cart, and it seemed like
an articulate voice; the town seemed to have a definite personality,
some great animal basking there in the sun, and its
face was the face of Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down on one of the seats in the shadiest part of
the garden; the trees hung over it in thick dark shadows,
and at times a breeze pushed like a bird’s wing through their
branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All around him the path was dark, beyond it was a broad
belt of light. He must have gone asleep, because almost
immediately he seemed to be dreaming. The shadows on
the path receded and advanced as a door opens and shuts;
the branches of the trees bent lower and lower. It seemed
in his dream that he recognised something menacing in their
movement, and he rose and passed through the garden and
in a moment he was in the town. Here too it was dark, and
in the market-place the tower stood, a black mass against the
grey sky behind it, and the streets twisted like snakes up and
down about the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly he was at Morelli’s house, he recognised
the strange carving and the crooked, twisting shape of
the windows. The door opened easily to his hand and he
passed up the stairs. The house was quite dark; he had
to grope to find his way. And then he was opposed by another
door, something studded with nails—he could feel them
with his hands—and heavily barred. He heard voices on
the other side of the door, low, soft whispers, and then he
recognised them, they were Tony and Morelli. He was
driven by an impulse to beat the door and get at them;
some fear clutched at his throat so that he felt that Tony
was in terrible danger. In a minute he knew that he would
be too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked, at first softly and then furiously; for a moment
the voices stopped, and then they began again. No
one paid any attention to his knocking. He knew with absolute
certainty that in a few minutes the door would open,
but first something would happen. He began to beat on the
door with his fists and to call out; the house was, for the rest,
perfectly silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly he heard Morelli’s laugh. There was
a moment’s silence, and then Tony screamed, a terrified,
trembling scream; the door began to open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick awoke to find himself on the garden seat with
his head sunk on his breast and some one looking at him; in
the hazy uncertainty of his waking his first thought was that
it was Janet—he had scarcely recovered from his dream.
He soon saw that it was not Janet, and, looking up confusedly,
blushed on finding that it was Alice Du Cane. She
was dressed in white, in something that clung about her and
seemed to be made all in one piece. It looked to him very
beautiful, and the great sweeping dark hat that she wore
must have been delightfully shady, but it only had the effect
of confusing him still more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew Alice Du Cane very slightly, in fact he couldn’t
really be said to know her at all. They said “good morning”
and “good evening,” and it had occasionally happened
that they had had to talk “just to keep the ball rolling” at
some odd minute or other, but she had always given him
the impression of being in quite “other worlds,” from which
she might occasionally look down and smile, but into which
he could never possibly be admitted. He had quite acquiesced
in all of this, although he had no feeling of the
kind about the rest of the party; but she belonged, he felt,
to that small, mysterious body of people who, in his mind
at any rate, “were the very top.” He was no snob about
them, and he did not feel that they were any the better people
for their high position, but he did feel that they were
different. There were centuries of tradition behind them,
that perhaps was really it, and there were the old houses
with their lawns and picture galleries, and there were those
wonderful ancestors who had ruled England from the beginning
of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had laughed sometimes when his wife had represented
to him that certain people in Epsom, alluded to in a hushed
voice and mysterious nods, were really “it.” He knew so
well that they were not; nothing to do with it at all. But
he always recognised “it” at once when it was there. He
did not recognise “it” in the Gales; there was a certain
quality of rest arising from assurance of possession that they
lacked, but Alice Du Cane had got “it,” most assuredly she
had got “it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He liked to watch her. She moved with so beautiful a
quiet and carried herself with so sure a dignity; he admired
her enormously, but had been quite prepared to keep his distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly he had seen that she was in love with
Tony, and she was at once drawn into the vortex. She became
something more than a person at whom one looked,
whom one admired as a picture; she was part of the situation.
He had been extremely sorry for her, and it had been
her unhappiness more than anything else that had worried
him about his part in the affair. But now, as he saw her
there watching him with a smile and leaning ever so slightly
on her parasol, of ever so delicate a pink, he was furiously
embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been sleeping, probably with his mouth open, and
she had been watching him. He jumped to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Du Cane,” he stammered, “I really——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she broke in upon him, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! what a shame! Really, Mr. Maradick, I didn’t
mean to, but the gravel scrunched or something and it woke
you. I’ve been doing the same thing, sleeping, I mean; it’s
impossible to do anything else with heat like this.” Then
her face grew grave. “All the same I’m not sure that I’m
sorry, because I have wanted to talk to you very badly all
day, and now, unless you <span class='it'>do</span> want to go to sleep again, it does
seem to be a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” he answered gravely, and he made way
for her on the seat. He felt the sinister afternoon pressing
upon him again. He was disturbed, worried, anxious; his
nerves were all to pieces. And then she did most certainly
embarrass him. The very way that she sat down, the careful
slowness of her movement, and the grace with which she
leant slightly forward so that the curve of her neck was like
the curve of a pink shell against her white dress, embarrassed
him. And he was tired, most undoubtedly tired; it
was all beginning to be too much for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he suddenly caught a look in her eyes as she
turned towards him; something melancholy and appealing
in it touched his heart and his embarrassment left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Maradick,” she began hurriedly, with her face again
turned away from him, “you are much older than I am,
and so I expect you’ll understand what I am trying to get at.
And anyhow, you know all that’s been going on this week,
more than anyone else does, and so there’s no need to beat
about the bush. Besides, I always hate it. I always want to
get straight at the thing, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. It was one of the true things about both
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, of course it’s about Tony. We all want to
know about Tony, and nobody does know except you, and
everybody’s afraid to ask you except myself, so there you are.
You mustn’t think me impertinent; I don’t mean to be, but
we <span class='it'>must</span> know—some of us, at any rate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>must</span> you know?” he said. He was suddenly on
his mettle. He resented the note of command in her voice.
About his general position in the world he was quite ready
to yield place, but about Tony’s affairs he would yield to
no one; that was another matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” she said, looking at him, “what <span class='it'>I</span> want
to know, what we all want to know, is what he is doing. Of
course we have all, by this time, a pretty good idea. I saw
him with that girl down on the beach, and it’s been pretty
obvious, by his being away so continually, what he is after.
No, it isn’t exactly so much what he is doing as whether it’s
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then,” said Maradick, facing her, “why exactly are
you asking me? Why not ask Tony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you know that would be no good,” she said, shaking
her head impatiently. “Tony would tell me nothing.
If he wanted to tell us anything he would have told us. You
can see how secret he’s been keeping it all. And you’re the
only other person who knows. Besides, I don’t want you
to betray any secrets, it’s only to tell us if it’s all right. If
you say it is then we shall know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who exactly is ‘we’?” Maradick asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice hesitated a moment. Then she said, “It’s Lady
Gale really who wants to know. She’s suffering terribly all
this time, but she’s afraid to ask you herself because you
might tell her too much, and then she couldn’t be loyal to
Sir Richard. But, you know, she spoke to you herself
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she did,” said Maradick slowly. “Then I suppose
that this, her sending you, means that she doesn’t quite
trust me now. She said before that she would leave it in my
hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She trusts you just as much, of course. Only—well,
you see, you haven’t known Tony all his life as we
have, you haven’t cared for him quite as much as we have.
And then I’m a woman, I should probably see a whole lot
of things in it that you couldn’t see. It’s only that you should
tell me a little about it, and then, if Lady Gale sees that we
both think it’s all right, she will be happier. Only, she’s
felt a little, just lately, that you weren’t very comfortable
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it only Lady Gale?” asked Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I want to know too. You see, I’ve
known Tony since we were both babies, and of course I’m
fond of him, and I should hate him to get in a mess”; she
finished up rather breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a strong feeling of the pathos of it all. He knew
that she was proud and that she had probably found it very
difficult to come to him as she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see now that she was struggling to keep her old
pride and reserve, but that she found it very hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was very tender as he spoke to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Du Cane,” he said, “I understand. I do indeed.
I would have spoken to Lady Gale herself if she hadn’t
begged me to keep quiet about it. Besides, I wasn’t sure,
I’m not sure now, how things were really going, and I was
afraid of alarming her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there <span class='it'>is</span> trouble?” Alice said; “you <span class='it'>are</span> anxious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not really,” Maradick hastened to assure her. “As
far as the main thing goes—the girl herself, I mean—it’s
the best thing that could possibly happen to Tony. The girl
is delightful; better than that, she is splendid. I won’t tell
you more, simply that it <span class='it'>is</span> all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Tony loves her?” Alice’s voice trembled in spite
of itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, heart and soul,” said Maradick fervently; “and I
think when you see her that you will agree about her. Only
you must see the difficulties as well as I do; what we are
doing is the only thing to do. I think that to take Tony
away now would lead to dreadful disaster. He must go
through with it. The whole thing has gone too far now for
it possibly to be stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then tell me,” Alice said slowly, “was she, do you suppose,
the girl that I saw down on the beach with Tony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick, “she must have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl got up slowly from the seat and stood with her
back to him, her slim white figure drawn to its full height;
the sun played like fire about her dress and hair, but there
was something very pathetic in the way that she let her arms
with a slow hopeless gesture fall to her side, and stared, motionless,
down the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned round to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Maradick,” she said, “that’s all I
wanted to know. I am happier about it, and Lady Gale
will be too. You’re quite right about taking Tony away.
It would only mean a hopeless break with Sir Richard, and
then his mother would be caught into it too, and that must
be averted at all costs. Besides, if she is as nice as you say,
perhaps, after all, it is the best thing that could happen.
And, at any rate,” she went on after a little pause, “we are
all most awfully grateful to you. I don’t know what we
should have done otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one was coming down the path. They both, at the
same moment, saw that it was Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice turned. “I must go,” she said. “Thank you again
for what you told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her walk down the path, very straight and
tall, with a grace and ease that were delightful to him. The
two women stopped for a moment and spoke; then Alice
passed out of sight and Mrs. Lester came towards him.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MARADICK IN A NEW RÔLE—HE AFTERWARDS SEES TONY’S</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>FACE IN A MIRROR</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t precisely know what his feelings were; he was
too hot, and the whole thing was too much of a surprise
for him to think at all; the thing that he did most
nearly resemble, if he had wanted similes, was some sharply
contested citadel receiving a new attack on its crumbling
walls before the last one was truly over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that again was not a simile that served with any accuracy,
because he was so glad, so tumultuously and intensely
glad, to see her. He wanted to keep that moment, that instant
when she was coming down the path towards him, quite
distinct from all the other moments of his life in its beauty
and colours, and so he focussed in his mind the deep green
of the trees and their purple shadows on the path, the noise
that two birds made, and the deep rustle as of some moving
water that her dress sent to him as she came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat there, one hand on each knee, looking straight before
him, motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester had that morning done her utmost to persuade
her husband to “play a game.” She was brimming over
with sentiment, partly because of the weather, partly because
Treliss always made her feel like that, partly because it was
“in the air” in some vague way through Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not understand it, but she knew that she had one
of her “fits,” a craving for excitement, for doing anything
that could give one something of a fling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her talk with her husband had also partly arisen from
her realisation of her feeling for Maradick. She was not a
very serious woman, she took life very lightly, but she knew
that her affection for her husband was by far the best and
most important thing in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew this through all the passing and temporary
moods that she might have, and she had learnt to dread those
moods simply because she never knew how far she might go.
But then Fred would be so provoking! As he was just now,
for instance, paying no attention to her at all, wrapped in
his stupid writing, talking about nerves and suggesting doctors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had tried very hard that morning to awaken him
to a sense of the kind of thing that was happening to her.
She had even, with a sudden sense of panic, suggested leaving
the place altogether, hinting that it didn’t suit her. But
he had laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, in fact, during these last few days, been thinking
of Maradick a great deal. For one thing, she hated
Mrs. Maradick; she had never in her life before hated anyone
so thoroughly. She took people easily as a rule and was
charitable in her judgment, but Mrs. Maradick seemed to
her to be everything that was bad. The little woman’s assumption
of a manner that quite obviously could never belong
to her, her complacent patronage of everybody and everything,
her appearance, everything seemed to Mrs. Lester the
worst possible; she could scarcely bear to stay in the same
room with her. She had, therefore, for Maradick a profound
pity that had grown as the days advanced. He had
seemed to her so patient under what must be a terrible affliction.
And so “the game” had grown more serious than
usual, serious enough to make her hesitate, and to run, rather
as a frightened child runs to its nurse, to Fred for protection.
But Fred wouldn’t listen, or, what was worse, listened
only to laugh. Well, on Fred’s head be it then!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not, however, set out that afternoon with any
intention of finding him; she was, indeed, surprised when she
saw him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both, at once, felt that there was something between
them that had not been there before; they were both nervous,
and she did not look at him as she sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lazy we are!” she, said. “Why, during the last
week we’ve been nothing at all but ‘knitters in the sun!’ I
know that’s a nice quotation out of somewhere, but I haven’t
the least idea where. But, as a matter of fact, it’s only the
irresponsible Tony who’s been rushing about, and he’s made
up for most of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was dressed in her favourite colour, blue, the very
lightest and palest of blue. She had a large picture hat
tied, in the fashion of a summer of a year or two before,
with blue ribbon under her chin; at her belt was a bunch of
deep crimson carnations. She took one of them out and
twisted it round in her fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking very cool and very cross,” she said, “and
both are irritating to people on a hot day. Oh! the heat!”
She waved her carnation in the air. “You know, if I had
my way I should like to be wheeled about in a chair carved
out of ice and sprayed by cool negroes with iced rose water!
There! Isn’t that Théophile Gautier and Théodore de Banville
and the rest? Oh dear! what rot I’m talking;
I’m——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” he said, looking her all over very slowly, “that
you’d be yourself, Mrs. Lester, just for a little. I hate all
that stuff; you know you’re not a bit like that really. I
want you as you are, not a kind of afternoon-tea dummy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am like that,” she said, laughing lightly, but also
a little nervously. “I’m always like that in hot weather
and at Treliss. We’re all like that just now, on the jump.
There’s Lady Gale and Sir Richard and Alice Du Cane, and
Rupert too, if he wasn’t too selfish, all worrying their eyes
out about Tony, and there’s Tony worrying his eyes out
about some person or persons unknown, and there’s my husband
worrying his eyes out about his next masterpiece, and
there’s you worrying your eyes out about——” She paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick, “about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I don’t know—something. It was easy enough to
see as one came along. I asked Alice Du Cane; she didn’t
know. What was she talking to you for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I don’t know; only she’s on the jump like the rest
of us and hasn’t honoured anyone with her conversation very
much lately. The place has got hold of you. That’s what
it is. What did I tell you? Treliss is full of witches and
devils, you know, and they like playing tricks with people
like yourself, incredulous people who like heaps of eggs and
bacon for breakfast and put half a crown in the plate on
Sundays. I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t say anything, so she went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I suppose Alice wanted to know what Tony was
doing. That’s what they all want to know, and the cat will
be out of the bag very soon. For my part, I think we’d all
better go away and try somewhere else. This place has upset
us.” Suddenly her voice dropped and she leant forward and
put her hand for a moment on his knee. “But please, Mr.
Maradick—we’re friends—we made a compact the other day,
that, while we were here, you know, we’d be of use to each
other; and now you must let me be of use, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That had never failed of its effect, that sudden passing
from gay to grave, the little emotional quiver in the voice,
the gentle touch of the hand; but now she was serious about
it, it was, for once, uncalculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it had its effect on him. A quiver passed through
his body at her touch; he clenched his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said in a low voice, “but I don’t think you can
help me just now, Mrs. Lester. Besides, I don’t think that
I want any help. As you say, we’re all a little strained
just now; the weather, I suppose.” He paused and then
went on: “Only, you don’t know what it is to me to have
you for a friend. I’ve thought a good deal about it these
last few days. I’ve not been a man of very many friends,
women especially little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life,” she said, “is so difficult.” She liked to talk about
life in the abstract; she was not a clever woman and she
never pretended to keep pace with her husband in all his
ideas, but, after all, it was something to be able to talk about
life at all—if one said that it was “queer” or “difficult”
or “odd” there was a kind of atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said it again; “Life is so difficult .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one really
doesn’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had never known,” he answered, looking steadily in
front of him, “until these last weeks how difficult it was.
You’ve made it that, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke in nervously, “Oh, surely, Mr. Maradick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was suddenly frightened of him. She thought she
had never seen anyone so strong and fierce. She could see
the veins stand out on the back of his hands and the great
curve of his arm as he leant forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he went on roughly, “I’m not fooling. I’d never
seen what life was before. These last weeks, you and other
things have shown me. I thought it was life just going on
in an office, making money, dining at home, sleeping. Rot!
That’s not life. But now! now! I know. I was forty.
I thought life was over. Rot! life’s beginning. I don’t
care what happens, I’m going to take it. I’m not going to
miss it again. Do you see? I’m not going to miss it again.
A man’s a fool if he misses it twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was speaking like a drunken man. He stumbled over
his words; he turned round and faced her. He saw the
ribbon under her chin rise and fall with her breathing. She
was looking frightened, staring at him like a startled animal.
He saw her dress in a blue mist against the golden path and
the green trees, and out of it her face rose white and pink
and a little dark under the eyes and then shadows under the
sweeping hat. He began to breathe like a man who has
been running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put out her hand with a gesture as though she would
defend herself, and gave a little cry as he suddenly seized
and crushed it in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent towards her, bending his eyes upon her. “No,
it’s rot, missing it again. My wife never cared for me;
she’s never cared. Nobody’s cared, and I’ve been a fool not
to step out and take things. It isn’t any use just to wait,
I see that now. And now we’re here, you and I. Just you
and I. Isn’t it funny? I’m not going to make love to you.
That’s rot, there isn’t time. But I’ve got you; I’m strong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was terrified and shrunk back against the seat, but
at the same time she had an overwhelming, overpowering
realisation of his strength. He was strong. His hand
crushed hers, she could see his whole body turning towards
her as a great wave turns; she had never known anyone so
strong before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Maradick! Please! Let me go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was thin and sharp like a child’s. But he suddenly
leaned forward and took her in his arms; he crushed
her against him so that she could feel his heart beating
against her like a great hammer. He turned her head
roughly with his hand and bent down and kissed her. His
mouth met hers as though it would never go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not breathe, she was stifled—then suddenly he
drew back; he almost let her fall back. She saw him bend
down and pick up his hat, and he had turned the corner of
the path and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know how he left the garden. He did not
see it or realise it, but suddenly he found himself in the
stretch of cornfield that reached, a yellow band, from horizon
to horizon. The field ran down the hill, and the little path
along which he stumbled crept in and out across the top of
the slope. Below the corn was the distant white road, and
curving round to the left was the little heap of white cottages
that stand, stupidly, almost timidly, at the water’s
edge. Then beyond that again was the wide blue belt of the
sea. The corn was dark brown like burnt sugar at the top
and a more golden yellow as it turned trembling to the
ground. The scarlet poppies were still split in pools and
lakes and rivers across its breast, and it seemed to have
caught some of their colour in its darker gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still not knowing what he was doing, he sat down heavily
on a little green mound above the path and looked with
stupid, half-closed eyes at the colour beneath him. He did
not take it in, his heart was still beating furiously; every
now and again his throat moved convulsively, his hands
were white against his knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, through his dazed feelings, he knew that he was glad
for what he had done. Very glad! A kind of strange triumph
at having really done it! There was something
pounding, drumming through his veins that was new—a
furious excitement that had never been there before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt no shame or regret or even alarm at possible consequences.
He did not think for an instant of Mrs. Maradick
or the girls. His body, the muscles and the nerves, the
thick arms, the bull neck, the chest like a rock—those were
the parts of him that were glad, furiously glad. He was
primeval, immense, sitting there on the little green hill with
the corn and the sea and the world at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not see the world at all, but there passed before his
eyes, like pictures on a shining screen, some earlier things
that had happened to him and had given him that same sense
of furious physical excitement. He saw himself, a tiny
boy, in a hard tight suit of black on a Sunday afternoon
in their old home at Rye. Church bells were ringing somewhere,
and up the twisting, turning cobbles of the street
grave couples were climbing. The room in which he was
hung dark and gloomy about him, and he was trying to prevent
himself from slipping off the shiny horsehair chair on
which he sat, his little black-stockinged legs dangling in the
air. In his throat was the heavy choking sensation of the
fat from the midday dinner beef. On the stiff sideboard
against the wall were ranged little silver dishes containing
sugar biscuits and rather dusty little chocolates; on the opposite
side of the room, in a heavy gilt frame, was the stern
figure of his grandmother, with great white wristbands and
a sharp pointed nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was trying to learn his Sunday Collect, and he had
been forbidden to speak until he had learnt it; his eyes were
smarting and his head was swimming with weariness, and
every now and again he would slip right forward on the
shiny chair. The door opened and a gentleman entered, a
beautiful, wonderful gentleman, with a black bushy beard
and enormous limbs; the gentleman laughed and caught him
up in his arms, the prayer-book fell with a clatter to the
floor as he buried his curly head in the beard. He did not
know now, looking back, who the gentleman had been, but
that moment stood out from the rest of his life with all its
details as something wonderful, magic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, later—perhaps he was about fifteen, a rather
handsome, shy boy—and he was in an orchard. The trees
were heavy with flowers, and the colours, white and pink,
swung with the wind in misty clouds above his head. Over
the top of the old red-brown wall a girl’s face was peeping.
He climbed an old gnarled tree that hung across the wall
and bent down towards her; their lips met, and as he leaned
towards her the movement of his body shook the branches
and the petals fell about them in a shower. He had forgotten
the name of the little girl, it did not matter, but the
moment was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then again, later still, was the moment when he had
first seen Mrs. Maradick. It had been at some evening
function or other, and she had stood with her shining shoulders
under some burning brilliant lights that swung from the
ceiling. Her dress had been blue, a very pale blue; and at
the thought of the blue dress his head suddenly turned, the
corn swam before him and came in waves to meet him, and
then receded, back to the sky-line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was another blue dress that he saw, not Mrs. Maradick’s—the
blue dress, the blue ribbon, the trees, the golden
path. His hands closed slowly on his knees as though he
were crushing something; his teeth were set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything, except the one central incident, had passed
from his mind, only that was before him. The minutes
flew past him; in the town bells struck and the sun sank towards
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a great effort and tried to think connectedly.
This thing that had happened would make a great change in
his life, it would always stand out as something that could
never be altered. Anyone else who might possibly have had
something to say about it—Mrs. Maradick, Mr. Lester—didn’t
count at all. It was simply between Mrs. Lester and
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very faint rose-colour crept up across the sky. It lingered
in little bands above the line of the sea, and in the air
immediately above the corn tiny pink cushions lay in heaps
together; the heads of the corn caught the faint red glow
and held it in the heart of their dark gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheer physical triumph began to leave Maradick. His
heart was beating less furiously and the blood was running
less wildly through his veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to wonder what she, Mrs. Lester, was thinking
about it. She, of course, was angry—yes, probably furiously
angry. Perhaps she would not speak to him again; perhaps
she would tell her husband. What had made him do it?
What had come to him? He did not know; but even now,
let the consequences be what they might, he was not sorry.
He was right whatever happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long time passed. He was sunk in a kind of lethargy.
The pink cushions in the sky sent out fingers along the blue
to other pink cushions, and ribbons of gold were drawn
across and across until they met in a golden flame above the
water. The sun was sinking and a little wind had stirred
the sea, the waves were tipped with gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze blew about his cheeks and he shivered. It
must be late; the sun was setting, the field of corn was sinking
into silver mist from out of which the poppies gleamed
mysteriously. Suddenly he thought of Tony. He had forgotten
the boy. He had come back to the hotel probably by
now; he remembered that he had said that he must be back
in time for dinner. But Tony’s affairs seemed very far
away; he did not feel that he could talk about things to-night,
or, indeed, that he could talk to anyone. He could
not go back to the hotel just yet. The sun had touched the
sea at last, and, from it, there sprung across the softly stirring
water a band of gold that stretched spreading like a
wing until it touched the little white houses now sinking into
dusk. The sky was alive with colour and the white road ran
in the distance, like a ribbon, below the corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bells struck again from the town; he rose and stood,
an enormous dark figure, against the flaming sky. There
was perfect stillness save for the very gentle rustle of the
corn. In the silence the stars came out one by one, the
colours were drawn back like threads from the pale blue,
and across the sea only the faintest gold remained; a tiny
white moon hung above the white houses and the white road,
the rest of the world was grey. The lights began to shine
from the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was cold and his limbs ached; the dim light, the mysterious
hour began to press about him. He had a sudden
wish, a sudden demand for company, people, lights, noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not people to talk to, of course; no, he did not want anyone
to talk to, but here, in this silence, with the mysterious
rustling corn, he was nervous, uneasy. He did not want
to think about anything, all that he wanted now was to forget.
He could not think; his brain refused, and there was
no reason why he should bother. To-morrow—to-morrow
would do. He stumbled down the path through the field; he
could not see very well, and he nearly fell several times
over the small stones in his path; he cursed loudly. Then
he found the hard white road and walked quickly down, past
the little white houses, over the bridge that crossed the river,
up into the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His need for company increased with every step that he
took; the loneliness, the half light, the cold breeze were melancholy.
He turned his head several times because he
thought that some one was following him, but only the white
road gleamed behind him, and the hedges, dark barriers, on
either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights of the town came to him as a glad relief. They
were not very brilliant; in the first streets of all the lamps
were very wide apart, and in between their dim splashes of
yellow were caverns of inky blackness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These streets were almost deserted, and the few people
that passed hurried as though they were eager to reach some
more cheerful spot. Very few lamps burnt behind the windows,
but Maradick felt as though the houses were so many
eyes eagerly watching him. Everything seemed alive, and
every now and again his ear caught, he fancied, the sound of a
measured tread in his rear. He stopped, but there was perfect
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His exultation had absolutely left him. He felt miserably
depressed and lonely. It seemed to him now that he
had cut off his two friends with a sudden blow for no reason
at all. Mrs. Lester would never speak to him again. Tony,
on his return, would be furious with him for not being there
according to his solemn promise. Lady Gale and Alice Du
Cane would lose all their trust in him; his wife would never
rest until she had found out where he had been that night,
and would never believe it if she did find out. He now saw
how foolish he had been not to go back to the hotel for dinner;
he would go back now if it were not too late; but it was
too late. They would have finished by the time that he was
up the hill again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was hungry and tired and cold; he greeted the lights
of the market-place with joy. It was apparently a night of
high festival. The lamps on the Town Hall side showed
crowds of swiftly moving figures, dark for a moment in the
shadows of the corner houses and then suddenly flashing into
light. The chief inn of the town, “The Green Feathers,”
standing flamboyantly to the right of the grey tower, shone
in a blazing radiance of gas. Two waiters with white cloths
over their arms stood on the top stair watching the crowd.
Behind them, through the open door, was a glorious glimpse
of the lighted hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people who moved about in the market were fishermen
and country folk. Their movement seemed aimless but
pleasant; suddenly some one would break into song, and for
a moment his voice would rise, as a fish leaps from the sea,
and then would sink back again. There was a great deal of
laughter and a tendency to grow noisier and more ill-disciplined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick, as he pushed his way through the crowd, was
reminded of that first night when Tony and he had come
down; the dance and the rest! What ages ago that seemed
now! He was another man. He pushed his way furiously
through the people. He was conscious now of tremendous
appetite. He had not eaten anything since lunch, and then
only very little. He was tired both mentally and physically;
perhaps after a meal he would feel better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked wearily up the steps of “The Green Feathers”
and accosted one of the waiters. He must have food, a room
alone, quiet. Maradick commanded respect; the waiter
withdrew his eye reluctantly from the crowd and paid attention.
“Yes—fish—a cutlet—a bottle of Burgundy—yes—perhaps
the gentleman would like the room upstairs. It was
a pleasant room. There was no one there just now; it
overlooked the market, but, with the windows down, the
noise——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of overlooking the market was rather pleasant;
the people and the lights would be there and, at the same
time, there would be no need to talk to anyone. Yes, he
would like that room. He walked upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much movement and bustle on the ground floor
of the inn, chatter and laughter and the chinking of glasses,
but above stairs there was perfect silence. The waiter
lighted candles, two massive silver candlesticks of venerable
age, and entered the long dining-room carrying them in front
of him. He explained that they had not lighted this room
with gas because candles were more in keeping. He hinted
at the eighteenth century and powder and ruffles. He almost
pirouetted as he held the candles and bent to put them on
the table by the window. He was most certainly a waiter
with a leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did, beyond question, suit the room with its long
gleaming walls and long gleaming table. The table at which
he was to dine was drawn up close to the window, so that he
could watch the antics of the square. The candle-light spread
as far as the long table and then spread round in a circle,
catching in its embrace a tall mirror that ran from the ceiling
to the floor. This mirror was so placed that a corner of
the square, with its lights and figures and tall dark houses,
was reflected in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room seemed close, and Maradick opened the window
a little and voices came up to him. In places the people
were bathed in light and he could see their faces, their eyes
and their mouths, and then in other parts there was grey
darkness, so that black figures moved and vanished mysteriously.
The tower reminded him curiously of the tower
in his dream; it rose black against the grey light behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dinner was excellent; the waiter was inclined to be
conversational. “Yes, it was some kind o’ feast day. No,
he didn’t know exactly. The place was full of superstitions—no,
he, thank Gawd, was from London—yes, Clapham,
where they did things like Christians—there were meringues,
apple-tart, or custard—yes, meringues.” He faded away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voices came up to the room. Vague figures of three people
could be seen below the window. The quavering voice
of an old man pierced the general murmurs of the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ’e’d seen the first wasp of the season, as early
back as April; yus, ’e was minded to give ’im a clout, but
’e missed it.” The wasp figured largely in the discussion.
They were all three rapidly reaching that stage when excessive
affection gives place to inimical distrust. The old man’s
voice quavered on. “If ’e called <span class='it'>’is</span> woman names then ’e
didn’t see why ’e shouldn’t call <span class='it'>’is</span> woman names.” This
led to futile argument. But the old man was obstinate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stars burnt high over the roofs in a silver cluster, and
then there trailed across the night blue a pale white path like
silk that was made of other stars—myriads of stars, back in
unlimited distance, and below them there hung a faint cloud
of golden light, the reflexion from the lamps of the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick’s dinner had done him good. He sat, with his
chair tilted slightly forward, watching the square. The
magnificent waiter had appeared suddenly, had caught the
food in a moment with a magical net, as it were, and had
disappeared. He had left whisky and soda and cigarettes
at Maradicks side; the light of two candles caught the
shining glass of the whisky decanter and it sparkled all
across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question of Tony had come uppermost again; that
seemed now the momentous thing. He ought to have been
there when Tony came back. Whatever he had done to Mrs.
Lester, or she to him—that matter could be looked at from
two points of view at any rate—he ought to have gone back
and seen Tony. The apprehension that he had felt during
the afternoon about the boy returned now with redoubled
force. His dream, for a time forgotten, came back with all
its chill sense of warning. That man Morelli! Anything
might have happened to the boy; they might be waiting for
him now up at the hotel, waiting for both of them. He
could see them all—Lady Gale, Alice Du Cane, Mrs. Lester,
his wife. He had in a way deserted his post. They had
all trusted him; it was on that condition that they had
granted him their friendship, that they had so wonderfully
and readily opened their arms to him. And now, perhaps
the boy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drank a stiff whisky-and-soda, his hand trembling a little
so that he chinked the glass against the decanter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt reassured. After all, what reason had he for
alarm? What had he, as far as Morelli was concerned, to
go upon? Nothing at all; merely some vague words from
Punch. The boy was perfectly all right. Besides, at any
rate, he wasn’t a fool. He knew what he was about, he could
deal with Morelli, if it came to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drank another whisky-and-soda and regarded the mirror.
It was funny the way that it reflected that corner of
the square, so that without looking at all out of the window
you could see figures moving, black and grey, and then suddenly
a white gleaming bit of pavement where the light fell.
His head became undoubtedly confused, because he fancied
that he saw other things in the mirror. He thought that
the crowd in the square divided into lines. Some one appeared,
dancing, a man with a peaked cap, dancing and playing
a pipe; and the man—how odd it was!—the man was
Morelli! And suddenly he turned and danced down the
lines of the people, still piping, back the way that he had
come, and all the people, dancing, followed him! They
passed through the mirror, dancing, and he seemed to recognise
people that he knew. Why, of course! There was
Tony, and then Janet Morelli and Lady Gale, Mrs. Lester,
Alice Du Cane; and how absurd they looked! There was
himself and Mrs. Maradick! The scene faded. He pulled
himself up with a jerk, to find that he was nodding, nearly
asleep; the idea of the music had not been entirely a dream,
however, for a band had gathered underneath the window.
In the uncertain light they looked strangely fantastic, so that
you saw a brass trumpet without a man behind it, and then
again a man with his lips pressed blowing, but his trumpet
fading into darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd had gathered round and there was a great deal
of noise; but it was mostly inarticulate, and, to some extent,
quarrelsome. Maradick caught the old man’s voice somewhere
in the darkness quavering “If ’e calls my old woman
names then I’ll call ’is old woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” It trailed off,
drowned in the strains of “Auld Lang Syne,” with which
the band, somewhat mistakenly, had commenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time was erratic; the band too, it seemed, had been
drinking, even now he could see that they had mugs at their
sides and one or two of them were trying to combine drink
and music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One little man with an enormous trumpet danced, at
times, a few steps, producing a long quivering note from his
instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd had made a little clearing opposite the window,
for an old man with a battered bowler very much on one
side of his head was dancing solemnly with a weary, melancholy
face, his old trembling legs bent double.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick felt suddenly sick of it all. He turned back
from the window and faced the mirror. He was unutterably
tired, and miserable, wretchedly miserable. He had
broken faith with everybody. He was no use to anyone; he
had deceived his wife, Lady Gale, Tony, Mrs. Lester, everybody.
A load of depression, like a black cloud, swung down
upon him. He hated the band and the drunken crowd; he
hated the place, because it seemed partly responsible for what
had happened to him; but above all he hated himself for
what he had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly he looked up and saw a strange thing. He
had pulled down the window, and the strains of the band
came very faintly through; the room was strangely silent.
The mirror shone very clearly, because the moon was hanging
across the roofs on the opposite side of the square. The
corner of the street shone like glass. Nearly all the crowd
had moved towards the band, so that that part of the square
was deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one man moved across it. He was coming with a
curious movement; he ran for a few steps and then walked
and then ran again. Maradick knew at once that it was
Tony. He did not know why he was so certain, but as he
saw him in the mirror he was quite sure. He felt no surprise.
It was almost as though he had been expecting him.
He got up at once from his chair and went down the stairs;
something was the matter with Tony. He saw the waiter in
the hall, and he told him that he was coming back; then he
crossed the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was coming with his head down, stumbling as though
he were drunk. He almost fell into Maradick’s arms. He
looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You! Maradick! Thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught hold of his arm; his face was white and drawn.
He looked twenty years older. His eyes were staring, wide
open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—take me somewhere where I—can have a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick took him, without a word, back to the inn. He
gulped down brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he sighed and pulled himself together. “I say,
let’s get back!” He did not loosen his hold of Maradick’s
arm. “Thank God you were here; I couldn’t have faced that
hill alone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that devil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Then he said under his
breath, “My God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick paid his bill and they left. They passed the
crowd and the discordant band and began to climb the hill.
Tony was more himself. “I say, you must think me a fool,
but, my word, I’ve had a fright! I’ve never been so terrified
in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morelli!” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; only the silly thing is, nothing happened. At least
nothing exactly. You see, I’d been there a deuce of a time;
I wanted to speak to him alone, without Janet, but he
wouldn’t let her go. It was almost as if he’d meant it. He
was most awfully decent all the afternoon. We fooled about
like anything, he and all of us, and then I had to give up
getting back to dinner and just risk the governor’s being
sick about it. We had a most ripping supper. He was topping,
and then at last Janet left us, and I began. But, you
know, it was just as if he knew what I was going to say and
was keeping me off it. He kept changing the subject—pleasant
all the time—but I couldn’t get at it. And then at
last my chance came and I asked him. He didn’t say anything.
He was sitting on the other side of the table, smiling.
And then suddenly, I don’t know what it was, I can’t describe
it, but I began to be terrified, horribly frightened.
I’ve never felt anything like it. His face changed. It was
like a devil’s. You could only see his eyes and his white
cheeks and the tips of his ears, pointed. He was still laughing.
I couldn’t stir, I was shaking all over. And then he
began to move, slowly, round the table, towards me. I
pulled myself together; I was nearly fainting, but I rushed
for the door. I got out just as he touched me, and then I
ran for my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was panting with terror at the recollection of it. They
were on the top of the hill. He turned and caught Maradick’s
hand. “I say,” he said, “what does it mean?”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>WHY IT IS TO BE THE TWENTY-SEVENTH, AND WHAT THE</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>CONNEXION WAS BETWEEN JANET’S BEING FRIGHTENED</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>AND TOBY’S JOINING THE GREAT MAJORITY</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all met at tea on the next afternoon, and for the
gods who were watching the whole affair from the
sacred heights of Olympus, it must have been a highly amusing
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lawrence was the only person who might really be
said to be “right out of it,” and she had, beyond question,
“her suspicions”; she had <span class='it'>seen</span> things, she had noticed.
She had always, from her childhood, been observant, and
anyone could see, and so on, and so on; but nevertheless,
she was really outside it all and was the only genuine spectator,
as far as mere mortals went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, things revolved round Sir Richard; it being
everyone’s hidden intention, for reasons strictly individual
and peculiar, to keep everything from him for as long a
period as possible. But everybody was convinced that he
saw further into the matter than anyone else, and was equally
determined to disguise his own peculiar cleverness from the
rest of the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was there, rather quiet and subdued. That was a
fact remarked on by everybody. Something, of course, had
happened last night; and here was the mystery, vague, indefinite,
only to be blindly guessed at, although Maradick
knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fine shades of everybody’s feelings about it all, the
special individual way that it affected special individual
persons, had to be temporarily put aside for the good of
the general cause, namely, the hoodwinking and blinding
of the suspicions of Sir Richard; such a business! Conversation,
therefore, was concerned with aeroplanes, about
which no one present had any knowledge at all, aeroplanes
being very much in their infancy; but they did manage to
cover a good deal of ground during the discussion, and everyone
was so extraordinarily and feverishly interested that it
would have been quite easy for an intelligent and unprejudiced
observer to discover that no one was really interested
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale was pouring out tea, and her composure was
really admirable; when one considers all that she had to
cover it was almost superhuman; but the central fact that
was buzzing beyond all others whatever in her brain, whilst
she smiled at Mrs. Lester and agreed that “it would be
rather a nuisance one’s acquaintances being able to fly over
and see one so quickly from absolutely anywhere,” was that
her husband had, as yet, said nothing whatever to Tony
about his last night’s absence. That was so ominous that she
simply could not face it at all; it meant, it meant, well, it
meant the tumble, the ruin, the absolute débâcle of the house;
a “house of cards,” if you like, but nevertheless a house
that her admirable tact, her careful management, her years
of active and unceasing diplomacy, had supported. What
it had all been, what it had all meant to her since Tony had
been anything of a boy, only she could know. She had
realised, when he had been, perhaps, about ten years old,
two things, suddenly and sharply. She had seen in the first
place that Tony was to be, for her, the centre of her life,
of her very existence, and that, secondly, Tony’s way through
life would, in every respect, be opposed to his father’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would, she saw, be a question of choice, and from the
instant of that clear vision her life was spent in the search
for compromise, something that would enable her to be
loyal to Tony and to all that his life must mean to him,
and something that should veil that life from his father.
She was, with all her might, “keeping the house together,”
and it was no easy business; but it was not until the present
crisis that it seemed an impossible one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had always known that the moment when love came
would be the moment of most extreme danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had vowed to her gods, when she saw what her own
marriage had made of her life, that her son should absolutely
have his way; he should choose, and she would be the very
last person in the world to stop him. She had hoped, she
had even prayed, that the woman whom he should choose
would be some one whom her husband would admit as possible.
Then the strength of the house would be inviolate and
the terrible moment would be averted. That was, perhaps,
the reason that she had so readily and enthusiastically welcomed
Alice Du Cane. The girl would “do” from Sir
Richard’s point of view, and Lady Gale herself liked her, almost
loved her. If Tony cared, why then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and at first
Tony had seemed to care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even while she had tried to convince herself, she knew
that it was not, for him at any rate, the “real thing.” One
did not receive it like that, with that calmness, and even
familiar jocularity, when the “real thing” came. But she
had persuaded herself eagerly, because it would, in nearly
every way, be so suitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly the “real thing” had come, come
with its shining eyes and beautiful colour; Tony had found
it. She had no hesitation after that. Tony must go on
with it, must go through with it, and she must prevent
Sir Richard from seeing anything until it was all over.
As to that, she had done her best, heaven knew, she had
done her best. But circumstances had been too strong for
her; she saw it, with frightened eyes and trembling hands,
slipping from her grasp. Why had Tony been so foolish?
Why had he stayed out again like that and missed dinner?
Why was he so disturbed now? It was all threatening to
fall about her ears; she saw the quarrel; she saw Tony,
arrogant, indignant, furious. He had left them, never to
return. She saw herself sitting with her husband, old, ill,
lonely, by some desolate fireside in an empty house, and
Tony would never return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she continued to discuss aeroplanes; she knew another
thing about her husband. She knew that if Tony was once
married Sir Richard might storm and rage but would eventually
make the best of it. The house must be carried on,
that was one of his fixed principles of life; Tony single, and
every nerve should be strained to make his marriage a fitting
one, but Tony married! Why then, curse the young fool,
what did he do it for? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but let us nevertheless have a
boy, and quick about it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Provided the girl were possible—the girl <span class='it'>must</span> be possible;
but she had Maradick’s word for that. He had told Alice
that she was “splendid!” Yes, let the marriage only take
place and things might be all right, but Sir Richard must not
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she continued to discuss aeroplanes. “Yes, there
was that clever man the other day. He flew all round the
Crystal Palace; what was his name? Porkins or Dawkins
or Walker; she knew it was something like Walker because
she remembered at the time wondering whether he had anything
to do with the Walkers of Coming Bridge—yes, such
nice people—she used to be a Miss Temple—yes, the <span class='it'>Daily
Mail</span> had offered a prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, Tony’s face terrified her. He was
standing by the window talking to Alice. She had never
seen him look like that before, so white and grave and stern—years
older. What had he been doing last night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave Mrs. Lawrence her third cup of tea. “Yes, but
they are such tiny cups—oh! there’s nothing. No, I’ve never
been up in a balloon—not yet—yes, I’m too old, I think; it
doesn’t do, you know, for me at my age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supposing it were all “off.” Perhaps it might be better;
but she knew that she would be disappointed, that she would
be sorry. One didn’t get the “real thing” so often in life
that one could afford to miss it. No, he mustn’t miss it—oh,
he <span class='it'>mustn’t</span> miss it. The older she grew, the whiter her
hair, the stiffer her stupid bones, the more eagerly, enthusiastically,
she longed that every young thing—not only Tony,
although he, of course, mattered most—should make the
most of its time. They didn’t know, dear people, how
quickly the years and the stiffness and the thinning of the
blood would come upon them. She wanted them all, all the
world under thirty, to romp and live and laugh and even
be wicked if they liked! but, only, they must not miss it,
they <span class='it'>must</span> not miss the wonderful years!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard was perfectly silent. He never said more
than a word or two, but his immobility seemed to freeze the
room. His hands, his head, his eyes never moved; his gaze
was fixed on Tony. He was sitting back in his chair, his
body inert, limp, but his head raised; it reminded the terrified
Mrs. Lawrence of a snake ready to strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lawrence found the situation beyond her. She found
a good many situations beyond her, because she was the kind
of person whom people continually found it convenient to
leave out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her attempts to force a way in—her weapons were unresting
and tangled volubility—always ended in failure; but she
was never discouraged, she was not clever enough to see that
she had failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting next to Sir Richard, and leant across him
to talk to Lady Gale. Mrs. Maradick and Mrs. Lester were
sitting on the other side of the table, Maradick talking
spasmodically to Lester in the background; Alice and Tony
were together at the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick had not spoken to Mrs. Lester since their parting
on the day before. He was waiting now until her eyes
should meet his; he would know then whether he were forgiven.
He had spent the morning on the beach with his
girls. He had come up to lunch feeling as he usually did
after a few hours spent in their company, that they didn’t
belong to him at all, that they were somebody else’s; they
were polite to him, courteous and stiffly deferential, as they
would be to any stranger about whom their mother had
spoken to them. Oh! the dreariness of it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it amused him, when he thought of it, that they, too,
poor innocent creatures, should be playing their unconscious
part in the whole game. They were playing it because they
helped so decisively to fill in the Epsom atmosphere, or
rather the way that he himself was thinking of Epsom—the
particular greyness and sordidness and shabbiness of the
place and the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come up to lunch, therefore, washing his hands
of the family. He had other things to think of. The immediate
affair, of course, was Tony, but he had had as yet no
talk with the boy. There wasn’t very much to say. It had
been precisely as he, Maradick, had expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli had refused to hear of it and Tony had probably
imagined the rest. In the calm light of day things that had
looked fantastic and ominous in the dark were clear and
straightforward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, Tony was very young and over-confident. Maradick
must see the man himself. And so that matter, too,
was put aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Lester was saying, “we are obviously pushing
back to Greek simplicity, and, if it isn’t too bold a thing to
say, Greek morals. The more complicated and material
modern life becomes the more surely will all thinking men
and lovers of beauty return to that marvellous simplicity.
And then the rest will have to follow, you know, one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” said Maradick absently. His eyes were fixed
on the opposite wall, but, out of the corners of them, he was
watching for the moment when Mrs. Lester should look up.
Now he could regard yesterday afternoon with perfect
equanimity; it was only an inevitable move in the situation.
He wondered at himself now for having been so agitated
about it; all that mattered was how she took it. The dogged,
almost stupid mood had returned. His eyes were heavy,
his great shoulders drooped a little as he bent to listen to
Lester. There was no kindness nor charity in his face as
he looked across the floor. He was waiting; in a moment
she would look up. Then he would know; afterwards he
would see Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so, you see,” said Lester, “Plato still has the last
word in the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lawrence was being entirely tiresome at the tea-table.
The strain of the situation was telling upon her.
She had said several things to Sir Richard and he had made
no answer at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He continued to look with unflinching gaze upon Tony.
She saw from Lady Gale’s and Mrs. Lester’s curious artificiality
of manner that they were extremely uneasy, and she
was piqued at their keeping her, so resolutely, outside intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was ill at ease she had an irritating habit of
eagerly repeating other people’s remarks with the words
a little changed. She did this now, and Lady Gale felt that
very shortly she’d be forced to scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be such a nuisance,” said Mrs. Lester, still continuing
the “flying” conversation, “about clothes. One will
never know what to put on, because the temperature will
always be so very different when one gets up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Lawrence eagerly, “nobody will have
the slightest idea what clothes to wear because it may be
hot or cold. It all depends——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one,” said Lady Gale, laughing, “will have to
shout down and tell us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Lawrence, “there’ll have to be a man
who can call out and let us know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony felt his father’s eyes upon him. He had wondered
why he had said nothing to him about his last night’s absence,
but it had not really made him uneasy. After all,
that was very unimportant, what his father or any of the
rest of them did or thought, compared with what Morelli
was doing. He was curiously tired, tired in body and tired
in mind, and he couldn’t think very clearly about anything.
But he saw Morelli continually before him. Morelli coming
round the table towards him, smiling—Morelli .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What was he doing to Janet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted to speak to Maradick, but it was so hard to
get to him when there were all these other people in the
room. The gaiety had gone out of his eyes, the laughter
from his lips. Maradick was everything now; it all depended
on Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking tired,” Alice said. She had been watching
him, and she knew at once that he was in trouble. Of
course anyone could see that he wasn’t himself, but she, who
had known him all his life, could see that there was more in
it than that. Indeed, she could never remember to have
seen him like that before. Oh! if he would only let her
help him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not been having a particularly good time herself
just lately, but she meant there to be nothing selfish about
her unhappiness. There are certain people who are proud of
unrequited affection and pass those whom they love with
heads raised and a kind of “See what I’m suffering for
you!” air. They are incomparable nuisances!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice had been rather inclined at first to treat Tony in
the same sort of way, but now the one thought that she had
was to help him if only he would let her! Perhaps, after
all, it was nothing. Probably he’d had a row with the girl
last night, or he was worried, perhaps, by Sir Richard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tony,” she said, putting her hand for a moment on his
arm, “we are pals, aren’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” pulling himself suddenly away from
Janet and her possible danger and trying to realise the girl
at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” she went on, looking out of the window, “I’ve
been a bit of a nuisance lately—not much of a companion,
I’m afraid—out of sorts and grumpy. But now I want you
to let me help if there’s anything I can do. There might
be something, perhaps. You know”—she stopped a moment—“that
I saw her down on the beach the other day. If
there was anything——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he began eagerly; “if you’re trying to find
out——” Then he stopped. “No, I know, of course you’re
not. I trust you all right, old girl. But if you only knew
what a devil of a lot of things are happening——” He
looked at her doubtfully. Then he smiled. “You’re a good
sort, Alice,” he said, “I know you are. I’m damned grateful.
Yes, I’m not quite the thing. There are a whole lot of
worries.” He hesitated again, then he went on: “I tell
you what you <span class='it'>can</span> do—keep the family quiet, you know.
Keep them off it, especially the governor. They trust you,
all of them, and you can just let them know it’s all right.
Will you do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled back at him. “Yes, old boy, of course. I
think I can manage Sir Richard, for a little time at any rate.
And in any case, it isn’t for very long, because we’re all
going away in about a week; twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth,
I think Lady Gale said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony started. “Did she?” he said. “Are you sure of
that, Alice? Because it’s important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I heard Lady Gale discussing it with Sir Richard
last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove. I’m glad to know that. Well, anyhow, Alice,
I’ll never forget it if you help us. We want it, by Jove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She noticed the “we.” “Oh, that’s all right,” she said,
smiling back at him. “Count on me, Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a general move was made. The meal,
to everyone’s infinite relief, was over. Mrs. Lester got up
slowly from her chair, she turned round towards Maradick.
For an instant her eyes met his; the corners of her mouth
were raised ever so slightly—she smiled at him, then she
turned back to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Maradick,” she said, “do come over and sit by the
window. There’ll be a little air there. The sun’s turned
the corner now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Maradick had seen the smile. Suddenly, in a
moment, all her suspicions were confirmed. She knew; there
could be no doubt. Mrs. Lester, Mrs. Lester and her husband—her
husband, James. Dear, how funny! She could
have laughed. It was quite a joke. At the same time, she
couldn’t be well, because the room was turning round, things
were swimming; that absurd carpet was rising and flapping
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand on the tea-table and steadied herself; then
she smiled back at Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll bring my work over,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the company seemed suddenly to have disappeared;
Maradick and Tony had gone out together, Lady
Gale and Alice, followed by Sir Richard and Lester, had
vanished through another door; only Mrs. Lawrence remained,
working rather dismally at a small square piece of
silk that was on some distant occasion to be christened a
table-centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick sometimes walked on her heels to increase
her height; she did so now, but her knees were trembling
and she had a curious feeling that the smile on her face was
fixed there and that it would never come off, she would smile
like that always.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she came towards the table where Mrs. Lester was
another strange sensation came to her. It was that she would
like to strangle Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she smiled at her across the table her hands were, in
imagination, stretching with long twisting fingers and encircling
Mrs. Lester’s neck. She saw the exact spot; she
could see the little blue marks that her fingers would leave.
She could see Mrs. Lester’s head twisted to one side and
hanging in a stupid, silly way over her shoulder. She would
draw her fingers very slowly away, because they would be
reluctant to let go. Of course it was a very stupid, primitive
feeling, because ladies that lived in Epsom didn’t strangle
other ladies, and there were the girls to be thought of, and
it wouldn’t really do at all. And so Mrs. Maradick sat
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite cool,” she said as she brought out her work,
“and after such a hot day, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester enjoyed the situation very much. She knew
quite well that Maradick had been watching her anxiously
all the afternoon. She knew that he was waiting to see
what she was going to do about yesterday. She had not
been quite sure herself at first. In fact, directly after he
had left her she had been furiously angry; and then she had
been frightened and had gone to find Fred, and then had
cried in her bedroom for half an hour. And then she had
dried her eyes and had put on her prettiest dress and had
come down to dinner intending to be very stiff and stately
towards him. But he had not been there; no one had known
where he was. Mrs. Maradick had more or less conveyed
that Mrs. Lester could say if she wanted to, but of course
she wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, she really didn’t know. The evening was stupid,
tiresome, and very long. As the hours passed memories grew
stronger. No one had ever held her like that before. She
had never known such strength. She was crushed, gasping.
There was a man! And after all, it didn’t matter; there was
nothing <span class='it'>wrong</span> in <span class='it'>that</span>. Of course he oughtn’t to have done
it. It was very presumptuous and violent; but then that
was just like the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the kind of thing that he did, the kind of thing,
after all, that he was meant to do! In the Middle Ages, of
course, would have been his time. She pictured him with
some beautiful maiden swung across the crupper, and the
husband, fist in air but impotent—that was the kind of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she had smiled at him, to show him that, after all,
she wasn’t very angry. Of course, she couldn’t be always
having it; she didn’t even mean that she’d altogether forgiven
him, but the whole situation was given an extra piquancy by
the presence of Mrs. Maradick. She didn’t mean any harm
to the poor little spectacle of a woman, but to carry him off
from under her very nose! Well! it was only human nature
to enjoy it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must come and see us, dear Mrs. Maradick, both
of you, when you’re back in town. We shall so like to see
more of you. Fred has taken enormously to your husband,
and it’s so seldom that he really makes a friend of anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so much,” said Mrs. Maradick, smiling,
“we’ll be sure to look you up. And you must come out to
Epsom one day. People call it a suburb, but really, you
know, it’s quite country. As I often say, it has all the advantages
of the town and country with none of their disadvantages.
A motor-van comes down from Harrods’ every
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be delightful,” said Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Lord Roseberry living so near makes it so pleasant.
He’s often to be seen driving; he takes great interest in the
school, you know—Epsom College for doctors’ sons—and
often watches their football!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” said Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick paused and looked out of the window.
What was she going to do? What was she going to do?
The great black elms outside the window swept the blue
sky like an arch. A corner of the lawn shone in the sun a
brilliant green, and directly opposite a great bed of sweet-peas
fluttered like a swarm of coloured butterflies with the
little breeze. What was she to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was feeling now, suddenly, for the first time in her
selfish, self-centred life utterly at a loss. She had never been
so alone before. There had always been somebody. At
Epsom there had been heaps of people; and, after all, if the
worst came to the worst, there had always been James. She
had never, in all these years, very actively realised that he
was there, because she had never happened to want him;
there had always been so many other people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now suddenly all these people had gone. Epsom was very,
very far away, and, behold, James wasn’t there either!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She realised, too, that if it had been some one down in the
town, a common woman as she had at first imagined it, it
would not have hurt so horribly. But that some one like
Mrs. Lester should care for James, should really think him
worth while, seemed at one blow to disturb, indeed to destroy
all the theories of life in general and of James in particular
that had governed her last twenty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could she see? What could any one of them see in
him? she asked herself again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, of course, it must all be stopped somehow.
They must go away at once. Or perhaps it would be better
to be quiet for a day or two and see. They would all be
gone in a week or so. And then Epsom again, and everything
as it had been and none of this—she called it “intrigue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad,” said Mrs. Lester, smiling, “that Tony
Gale has taken so strong a liking to your husband. It’s so
good for a boy of that age to have some one older.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He’s
a charming boy, of course, but they always need some one
at that age just to prevent them from doing anything foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>This</span> was fishing, Mrs. Maradick at once felt. She
couldn’t see exactly what Mrs. Lester wanted, but she <span class='it'>did</span>
want something, and she wasn’t going to get it. She had
a sudden desire to prove to Mrs. Lester that she was a
great deal more to her husband than appeared on the surface.
A great deal more, of course, than any of the others were.
For the first time in their married life she spoke of him
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! James,” she said, “is splendid with young men.
Only I could really tell the world what he has been to some
of them. They take to him like anything. There’s something
so strong and manly about him—and yet he’s sympathetic.
Oh! I could tell you——” She nodded her head
sagaciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Lester; “I can’t tell you how I admire
him, how we all do, in fact. He must be very popular in
Epsom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as a matter of fact he rather keeps himself to
himself there. They all like him enormously, of course; but
he doesn’t want anything really except just the family—myself
and the girls, you know. He’s a very domestic man,
he always has been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, one can see that,” said Mrs. Lester, smiling. “It’s
delightful when one sees that nowadays. It so seldom happens,
I am afraid. You must be very proud of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” said Mrs. Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impulse to lean over and take Mrs. Lester’s head and
slowly bend it back until the bones cracked was almost too
strong to be resisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick pricked her finger and stopped the blood
with her handkerchief. Both ladies were silent. The last
rays of the sun as it left the corner of the lawn fell in a golden
shower upon the sweet-peas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lawrence could be heard counting her stitches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mrs. Lester’s smile had had its effect upon
Maradick. He had waited, tortured, for the smile to come,
but now it was all right. They were still friends. He
could not see it any farther than that. After all, why should
he trouble to look at it any more deeply? They were friends.
He would be able to talk to her again; he would see her
smile again. If she did not want him to behave like that,
if she did not want him to hold her hand, he was ready to
obey in anything. But they were still friends. She was not
angry with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His depression took wings and fled. He put his arm on
Tony’s shoulder as they went down the stairs. “Well, old
chap,” he said, “I’m off to see Morelli now. You can bet
that it will be all right. Things looked a bit funny last
night. They always do when one’s tired and it’s dark.
Last night, you see, you imagined things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tony looked up at him quietly with grave eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “there was nothing to imagine. It was
just as I told you. Nothing happened. But I know now
that there’s something in what the chaps in the town said.
I believe in devils now. But my God, Maradick”—he
clutched the other’s arm—“Janet’s down there. It isn’t
for myself I care. He can do what he likes to me. But
it’s <span class='it'>her</span>, we must get her away or there’s no knowing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I didn’t sleep a wink last night, thinking what he might
be doing to her. He may carry her away somewhere, where
one can’t get at her; or he may do—God knows. But that’s
what he said last night, just that! that she wasn’t for me
or for anyone, that she was <span class='it'>never</span> for anyone—that he would
keep her.” Tony broke off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m silly with it all, I think,” he said, “it’s swung me
off my balance a bit. One can’t think; but it would be the
most enormous help if you’d go and see. It’s the uncertainty
that’s so awful. If I could just know that it’s all
right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and meanwhile I’m thinking out plans. It’s
all got to happen jolly soon now. I’ll talk when you come
back. It’s most awfully decent of you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick left him pacing the paths with his head down
and his hands clenched behind his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Morelli sitting quietly with Janet and Miss
Minns in the garden. They had had tea out there, and the
tea-things glittered and sparkled in the sun. It would have
been difficult to imagine anything more peaceful. The high
dark red brick of the garden walls gave soft velvet shadows
to the lawn; the huge tree in the corner flung a vast shade
over the beds and paths; rooks swung slowly above their
heads through the blue spacious silence of the summer evening;
the air was heavy with the scent of the flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli came forward and greeted Maradick almost
eagerly. “What! Have you had tea? Sure! We can
easily have some more made, you know. Come and sit down.
Have a cigar—a pipe? Right. I wondered when you were
going to honour us again. But we had young Gale in yesterday
evening for quite a long time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet, with a smile of apology, went indoors. Miss Minns
was knitting at a distance. This was obviously the right
moment to begin, but the words would not come. It all
seemed so absurd in this delicious garden with the silence
and the peace, and, for want of a better word, the sanity of
it all; all the things that Maradick had been thinking,
Tony’s story and the fantastic scene in the market-place last
night, that and the ideas that had sprung from it, were all
so out of line now. People weren’t melodramatic like that,
only one had at times a kind of mood that induced one to
think things, absurd things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Morelli seemed to be waiting for Maradick to speak.
He sat gravely back in his chair watching him. It was
almost, Maradick thought, as though he knew what he had
come there for. It was natural enough that Morelli should
expect him, but he had not imagined precisely that kind of
quiet waiting for him. He had to clear all the other ideas
that he had had, all the kind of picture that he had come
with, out of his head. It was a different kind of thing, this
sheltered, softly coloured garden with its deep shadows
and high reds and browns against the blue of the sky. It
was not, most emphatically it was not, melodrama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uncomfortable thought that the quiet eyes and grave
mouth had guessed all this precipitated Maradick suddenly
into speech. The peace and silence of the garden seemed
to mark his words with a kind of indecency. He hurried
and stumbled over his sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you know,” he said. “I thought I’d just come in
and see you—well, about young Gale. He told me—I met
him—he gave me to understand—that he was here last
night.” Maradick felt almost ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Morelli, smiling a little, “we had some considerable
talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he told me, that he had said something to you
about your daughter. You must forgive me if you think that
I’m intrusive at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli waved a deprecating hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course I’m a friend of the boy’s, very fond of
him. He tells me that he spoke about your daughter. He
loves Miss Morelli.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Morelli gently, “he did speak to me about
Janet. But of course you must look on it as I do; two
such children. Mind you, I like the boy, I liked him from
the first. He’s the sort of young Englishman that we can’t
have too much of, you know. My girl wouldn’t be likely
to find a better, and I think she likes him. But of course
they’re too young, both of them. You must feel as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could this be the mysterious terror who had frightened
Tony out of his wits? This gentle, smiling, brown-faced
little man lying back there so placidly in his chair with his
eyes half closed? It was impossible on the face of it.
Absurd! And perhaps, after all, who knew whether it
wouldn’t be better to wait? If Morelli really felt like that
about it and was prepared eventually to encourage the idea;
and then after all Janet might be introduced gradually to
the family. They would see, even Sir Richard must see
at last, what a really fine girl she was, fine in every way. He
saw her as she had stood up to meet him as he stepped across
the lawn, slim, straight, her throat rising like a white stem
of some splendid flower, her clear dark eyes pools of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! they must see if you gave them time. And, after
all, this was rather carrying the matter with a high hand,
this eloping and the rest!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The garden had a soothing, restful effect upon him, so
that he began to be sleepy. The high red walls rose about
him on every side, the great tree flung its shadow like a
cloud across, and the pleasant little man smiled at him with
gentle eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, of course, they are very young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then there’s another thing,” went on Morelli. “I
don’t know, of course, but I should say that young Gale’s
parents have something else in view for him in the way of
marriage. They’re not likely to take some one of whom they
really know nothing at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They’ll want, naturally
enough, I admit, something more.” He paused for a moment,
then he smiled. “But perhaps you could tell me,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick had again the sensation that the man knew
perfectly well about the whole affair, about the Gales and
Alice and Tony, and even perhaps about himself. He also
felt that whatever he could say would be of no use at all;
that Morelli was merely playing with him, as a cat plays with
a mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile he had nothing to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see,” he began awkwardly, “as a matter of
fact, they haven’t had the opportunity—the chance, so to
speak, of knowing—of meeting Miss Morelli yet. When
they do——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve been here,” broke in Morelli quietly, “some
weeks now. Lady Gale could have called, I suppose, if she
had been interested. But I gather that Gale hasn’t told
her; hasn’t, indeed, told any of them. You see,” he added
almost apologetically, “she is my only child; she has no
mother; and I must, in a way, see to these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick agreed. There was really nothing to be said.
It was perfectly true that the Gales didn’t want Janet,
wouldn’t, in fact, hear of her. The whole affair seemed to
lose a great deal of its immediate urgency in this quiet and
restful place, and the fact that Morelli was himself so quiet
and restful was another motive for waiting. The girl was
in no danger; and, strangely enough, Maradick seemed to
have lost for the first time since he had known Morelli the
sense of uneasy distrust that he had had for the man; he
was even rather ashamed of himself for having had it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said slowly, “you don’t object to things being
as they are for a time. I’m sure Tony will see it sensibly,
and perhaps Miss Morelli might meet Lady Gale. It would
be a pity, don’t you think, to put a stop altogether to the
acquaintance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah yes,” said Morelli, “certainly. We’ll say no more
about it for the present. It was very pleasant as it was.
As I told you, I like young Gale; and who knows?—perhaps
one day——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick sat back in his chair and looked up lazily at
the sky. It was all very pleasant and comfortable here in
this delicious old garden; let the matter rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Morelli proved himself a most delightful companion.
He seemed to have been everywhere and to have
seen everything. And it was not only knowledge. He put
things so charmingly; he had a thousand ways of looking at
things, a thousand ways of showing them off, so that you saw
them from new points of view, and the world was an amusing,
entertaining treasure-house of wonders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes slipped by; the sun went down the sky, the
shadow of the tree spread farther and farther across the
lawn, the pinks and roses lay in bunches of red and pink
and yellow against the dark background of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick got up to go and Morelli walked with him, his
hat set back, his hands in his pockets. As they entered the
house he said, “Ah, by the way, there was that Spanish
sword that I promised to show you. It’s a fine thing and of
some value; I’ll bring it down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disappeared up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Janet was at Maradick’s elbow. He had not seen
her coming, but she looked round with quick, startled eyes.
Her white dress shone against the dark corners of the hall.
He saw, too, that her face was very white and there were
dark lines under her eyes; to his surprise she put her hand
on his arm, she spoke in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Maradick, please,” she said, “I must speak to you.
There is only a minute. Please listen, it’s dreadfully important.
Tony says you want to help us. There isn’t anyone
else;” she spoke in little gasps and her hand was at her
throat as though she found it difficult to breathe. “I must
get away somehow, at once, I don’t know what will happen if
I don’t. You don’t know father, and I can’t explain now,
but I’m terribly frightened; and he will suddenly—I can
see it coming.” She was nearly hysterical; he could feel her
whole body trembling. “Tony said something yesterday
that made father dreadfully angry. Tony ought not to have
come; anything might happen when father’s like that. If
you can’t help me I will run away; but you <span class='it'>must</span> help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She grew calmer but still spoke very rapidly, still throwing
frightened glances at the stairs. “Listen; on the twenty-seventh—that’s
Thursday—father’s going away. He’s going
to Pendragon for the whole day; it was arranged long ago.
He was to have taken me, but he has decided not to; I heard
him tell Miss Minns—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suddenly she was gone again, as quietly as she had
come. He saw now that there had been a door behind her
leading to some room. He looked up and saw that Morelli
was coming downstairs carrying the sword. Five minutes
afterwards he had left the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had all happened so suddenly, so fantastically, that it
was some minutes before he could straighten it out. First
he had the impression of her, very young, very frightened,
very beautiful. But there was no question of the reality of
her terror. All the feelings of danger that he had had with
Tony last night came crowding back now. It was true then?
It hadn’t only been Tony’s imagination. After all, Janet
must know. She hadn’t lived with her father all those years
without knowing more about it than he, Maradick, possibly
could. She wouldn’t have been likely to have taken the risk
of seeing him like that if there was nothing in it, if there
was only the mere ordinary domestic quarrel in it. But
above all, there was the terror in her eyes; that he had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not, he must not, leave her then. There was
danger threatening her somewhere. The whole business had
entirely changed from his original conception of it. It had
been, at first, merely the love affair of a boy and girl, and
he, from a pleasant sense of romance and a comfortable conviction
that it was all good for his middle-aged solidity, had
had his share in it. But now it had become suddenly a
serious and most urgent affair, perhaps even a matter of life
and of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, as he had turned before, to Punch. There was
no time to lose, and he was the man to see about it; he must
find him at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights were coming out in the town as he passed
through the streets; there were not many people about, and
the twilight was lingering in the air so that all the colours
of the sky and the houses and the white stretches of pavement
had a faint pure light. The sky was the very tenderest
blue, and the last gleam from the setting sun still lingered
about the dark peaks and pinnacles of the houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was soon on the outskirts of the town, and at last he
trod the white high road. At the farther turn were Punch’s
lodgings. There was a full round globe of a moon, and below
him he could hear the distant beating of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one was walking rapidly behind him; he turned
round, and to his astonishment saw, as the man came up to
him, that it was the very person for whom he was looking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that’s splendid, Garrick,” he said, “I was just coming
for you. I’m a bit worried and I want your advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a bit worried too, sir, as a matter of fact,” said
Punch, “but if there’s anything I can do——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick saw now that the man was very different from
his usual cheerful self. He was looking anxious, and his
eyes were staring down the road as though he were expecting
to see something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s the dog,” said Punch, “Toby, you know. He’s
missing, been gone all the afternoon. Not that there’s very
much in that in the ordinary way. He often goes off by
’imself. ’E knows the neighbourhood as well as I do; besides,
the people round ’ere know him and know his mind.
But I’m uneasy this time. It’s foolish, perhaps, but when
a man’s got only one thing in the world——” He stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should you be uneasy?” said Maradick. The
loss of a dog seemed a very small thing compared with his
own affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as a matter of fact, it’s Morelli.” The lines of
Punch’s mouth grew hard. “’E’s owed me a grudge ever
since I spoke to ’im plain about them animals. And ’e knows
that I know a good bit, too. He passed me in the market-place
two days back, and stopped for an instant and looked
at the dog. To them that don’t know Morelli that’s nothing;
but for them that do—’e’d think nothing of having his bit of
revenge. And it’s late now, and the dog’s not home.” The
little man looked at Maradick almost piteously, as though he
wanted to be reassured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I expect it’s all right,” said Maradick. “Anyhow,
I’ll come along with you and we can talk as we go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few words he explained what had happened that
afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch stopped for a moment in the road and stared into
Maradick’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get ’er away, sir,” he said, “whatever you do, get ’er
away. I know the girl; she wouldn’t have spoken to you
like that unless there was something very much the matter.
And I know the man; there’s nothing ’e’d stop at when ’e’s
roused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,” said Maradick, “if he feels like this about it
did he let them go about together? He helped them in every
way. He seemed to love to have Tony there. I can’t understand
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, sir, if you take Morelli as an ordinary man you
won’t understand ’im. But ’e’s a kind of survival. ’E
loves to be cruel, as they did in the beginning of things when
they didn’t know any better. It’s true. I’ve seen it once
or twice in my life. It’s a lust like any other lust, so that
your body quivers with the pleasure of it. But there’s more
in it than that. You see ’e wants to have young things about
’im. ’E’s always been like that; will play with kittens and
birds and puppies, and then p’r’aps, on a sudden, kill them.
That’s why he took to young Gale, because of ’is youth. And
’e liked to watch them together; but now, when young Gale
comes and talks of marriage, why, that means that they both
leave ’im and ’e can’t play with them any more, so ’e’ll kill
them instead. Take ’er away, sir, take ’er away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were out now upon the moor that ran between the
woods and the sea; the world was perfectly still save for
the distant bleating of some sheep and the monotonous tramp
of the waves on the shore far below them. There was no
sign of any other human being; the moon flung a white unnatural
light about the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch walked with his eyes darting from side to side;
every now and again he whistled, but there was no answering
bark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may seem a bit absurd to you, sir,” Punch said almost
apologetically, “to be fussing this way about a dog, but ’e’s
more to me than I could ever explain. If I hadn’t got ’im
to talk to and have about at nights and kind o’ smile at when
you’re wanting company the world would be another kind of
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick tried to fix his mind on Punch’s words, but the
ghostliness of the place and the hour seemed to hang round
him so that he could not think of anything, but only wanted
to get back to lights and company. Every now and again he
turned round because he fancied that he heard steps. Their
feet sank into the soft soil and then stumbled over tufts of
grass. Faint mists swept up from the sea and shadowed the
moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind them the lights of the town twinkled like the watching
eye of some mysterious enemy. A bird rose in front of
them with shrill protesting cries, and whirled, screaming,
into the skies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch seemed to be talking to himself. “Toby, boy, where
are you? Toby, old dog. You know your master and you
wouldn’t hide from your master. It’s time to be getting
home, Toby. Time for bed, old boy. Damn the dog, why
don’t ’e come? Toby, old boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every few minutes he started as though he saw it, and
he would run forward a few paces and then stop. And indeed,
in the gathering and shifting mist that went and came
and took form and shape, there might have been a thousand
white dogs wandering, an army of dogs, passing silently,
mysteriously across the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toby, old boy, it’s time to be getting back. ’E was that
used to the place you couldn’t imagine ’is being lost anywhere
round about. ’E was that cunning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the army of dogs passed silently by, curving with their
silent feet in and out of the mists. One new dog had joined
their ranks. He fell in at the rear and went by with the
others; but his master did not see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the mists broke and the moon shone out across
the moor like a flame. The moon leapt into the light. A
little to the right on a raised piece of ground lay something
white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The army of dogs had vanished. The woods, the moor,
the sea, were bathed in white colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch ran forward with a cry; he was down on his knees
and his arms were round the dog’s body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent down, and for a moment there was perfect silence,
only, in a far distant field, some sheep was crying. Then
he looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears were rolling down his face; he lifted his hand
and brushed them back. “It’s Toby. My dog! ’E’s been
killed. Something’s torn ’im.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent down and picked it up and held it in his arms.
“Toby, old dog, it’s time to go back. It’s all right; ’e hasn’t
hurt you, old boy. It’s all right.” He broke off. “Curse
him,” he said, “curse him! ’E did it—I know his marks—I’ll
kill ’im for it.” His hands fell down to his side.
“Toby, old dog! Toby.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon crept back again behind the mist. In the
shadow the man sat nursing the dog in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far below him sounded the sea.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MRS. LESTER, TOO, WOULD LIKE IT TO BE THE TWENTY-SEVENTH</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>BUT MARADICK IS AFRAID OF THE DEVIL</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Monday the 24th the weather broke. Cold winds
swept up from the sea, mists twisted and turned about
the hotel, the rain beat in torrents against the panes. In all
the rooms there were fires, and it seemed impossible that,
only the day before, there should have been a burning, dazzling
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after lunch, and Lady Gale and Tony were sitting
over the fire in the drawing-room. Tony had been obviously
not himself during these last few days, and his mother felt
that her silence could last a very little time longer. However,
matters were at length approaching a crisis. Things
must decide themselves one way or the other in a day or
two, for Sir Richard had, at lunch, announced his intention
of departing on Saturday the 29th; that is, they had the inside
of a week, and then Treliss, thank Heaven, would be
left behind. Surely nothing very much could happen in a
week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her earlier feeling, that above all she did not want Tony
to miss this girl if she were the right one for him, had yielded
now to a kind of panic. All that she could think of now
was to get him away. There was a look in his eyes that she
had never seen in his face before. It was a look that aged
him, that robbed him altogether of that delightful youth and
vitality that had been his surprising, his charming gift!
But there was more than a look of weariness and distress,
there was positive fright there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched him when he was in the room with her, and
she had seen him suddenly start and tremble, fling back his
head as though he expected to find some one behind him.
He, her boy Tony, who had never been afraid of anyone or
anything. And then, too, she had seen a new look of determination
in his mouth and eyes during these last days.
His mind was made up to something, but to what she was too
afraid to think!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must get him away, and she had heard her husband’s
decision about Saturday with tremendous relief. She had
watched Tony’s face at the announcement. But it had not
changed at all; only, for a moment he had looked quickly
across at Maradick; it had apparently not startled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His indifference frightened her. If he was taking it so
calmly then he must have decided on something that this
date could not affect, on something probably before the date?
But what could he do before Saturday? She seemed to miss
altogether the obvious thing that he could do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it had been seldom enough that she had had him to
herself during these last weeks, and now she snatched eagerly
at her opportunity. She sat on one side of the fire, one hand
up to shield her face, her rings glittering in the firelight; her
brown dress stood out against the white tiles of the fireplace
and her beautiful snow-white hair crowned her head
gloriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony sat at her feet, one hand in hers. He stared straight
before him into the fire. She had noticed during these last
three days a delightful tenderness towards her. His attitude
to her had always been charming, courteous, affectionate and
yet companionable; but now he seemed to want to do everything
that he could to show her that he loved her. And yet
though she valued and treasured this it also frightened her.
It was a little as though he were preparing for some departure,
at any rate some change, that might hurt her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, they were going at the end of the week, only a few
more days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her fingers and stroked them. His hand stopped
at the wedding ring and he passed his thumb across it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, mother,” he looked up in her face with a little
laugh, “I suppose you’d say that you’d rather lose anything
in the world than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, it’s very precious;” but she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it is. It must be ripping having something
that is just yours and nobody else’s, that you simply don’t
share with anyone. It must be ripping having somebody
that belongs to you and that you belong to; just you two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, But that ring means more to me than that. It
means you and Rupert as well as your father. It means
all those hours when you screamed and kicked, and the day
when you began to talk, and the first adventurous hours when
you tried to cross the nursery floor. And yes, a thousand
things besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old mater,” he said softly. “It’s been just ripping
having you. You’ve always understood so splendidly. Some
chaps’ mothers I’ve seen, and they don’t know their sons in
the very least. They do all the things that are most likely
to drive them wild, and they never seem to be able to give
them a bit what they want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but it works both ways,” she answered. “A son’s
got to try and understand his mother too. It’s no use their
leaving it all to her, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not.” Then he turned his body round
and looked her in the face. “But you do understand so
splendidly. You always have understood. You see, you
trust a fellow.” Then he added quickly, “You’re trusting
me now, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered, looking at him steadily, “perfectly.
Only, just these last few days, perhaps I’ve been a little tiny
bit worried. You haven’t been looking happy, and then I’m
always worried; it’s so seldom that you’re not all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’d rather not know—what’s going on, I mean.
It’s all right, perfectly right, and if it wasn’t—if it wasn’t
right for you, I mean, as well as for me—I wouldn’t go on
with it for a moment. Only it’s dreadfully important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, I know. And if Mr. Maradick knows about
it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a brick, isn’t he?” Tony interrupted eagerly.
“You know, so few middle-aged men can understand the
point of view of a chap who’s only about twenty-five. They
are either fatherly and patronising or schoolmasterly and
bossing, or kind of wise and beneficent; but Maradick’s most
awfully young really, and yet he’s wise too. He’s a ripper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped. They neither of them spoke for some minutes.
“It will be quite all right, mother,” he said, “very
soon. Just now things are a little difficult, but we’ll pull
through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and stood looking down at her. “You are a
brick to trust me and not to ask,” he said. “It would make
things so awfully difficult if you asked.” He bent down and
kissed her. “It’s a bit of luck having you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as soon as he had left the room his face was serious
again. He passed Mrs. Lester on the stairs and smiled and
hurried on. It was all very well; she was there, of course,
real enough and all that sort of thing, but she simply didn’t
count for him at that moment, she didn’t exist, really, any
more than the hotel or the garden did. Nothing existed
except that house in the town with Janet somewhere in it
waiting for him to set her free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the one point on which his eyes were now fixed.
In his earlier days it had, perhaps, been one of his failings—that
he had run rather too eagerly after too many interests,
finding in everything so immediate an excitement that he
forgot the purpose of yesterday in the purpose of to-day. It
had always been the matter with him that he had too many
irons in the fire. Life was so full and such fun!—that had
been the excuse. <span class='it'>Now</span> it was deadly earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was the first time that the world had so resolved
into one single point for him. He was already years older;
these last days had made him that, the uncertainties, the
indecisions, the fluctuating enthusiasms, the passing from
wonder to wonder. All these had solidified into one thing,
and one thing only—Janet, how to get her out, how to marry
her, how to have her for always; the rest of the world was
in shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day was Monday; Tuesday, Wednesday, and then
Thursday, Thursday the 27th. That was the day on which
everything must be done. He was thinking it all out, they
had got that one chance. If they missed it Morelli would be
back, and for ever. They must not miss it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was perfectly calm about it. His agitation seemed
curiously to have left him. He was cold and stern and
absolutely collected. He and Maradick were going to pull
it through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not find Maradick. He searched for him in the
dining-room, the passages, the billiard-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. The servants hadn’t seen him. Mrs. Maradick was
with Mrs. Lawrence in one of the drawing-rooms; no, they
hadn’t see him, he had disappeared after lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick smiled. “Find Mrs. Lester” was the
advice that she would have given him. She went back to her
novel with tightly closed mouth and refused to talk to Mrs.
Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Tony suddenly remembered. Of course, he
would be up in that old room where he so often went, the
room with the gallery. Tony found him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain was beating furiously against the panes, and
there was a very dismal light that struggled across the floor
and lost itself hopelessly in the dark corners under the gallery.
Maradick was sitting close up against the window, reading
in the rather feeble light. He looked up when he saw Tony
and put his book down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tony, I was coming down to find you; Sir Richard’s
decision at lunch pretty well settles things, doesn’t it? We
must move at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up at the boy and saw the age in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry,” he said. “We’re going to pull it through
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not worrying,” Tony answered shortly. “It’s
too damned serious, and besides, there’s no time.” He
paused as though he were collecting his thoughts, and then
he went on. “Look here, I’ve thought it all out. I’ve been
able to write to Janet and have had several letters from her.
She’s plucky, my word, you can’t think! Anyhow, that
beast’s all right for the moment, it seems, only he keeps looking
at her as though he was meaning to do something, and
she’s terribly frightened, poor little girl. But he’s going on
Thursday all right, and that’s when we’ve got to do the trick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick. “I’m absolutely at your service.”
Their positions had changed. Tony was taking the lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Tony, very solemnly and speaking rather
quickly. “It’s all got to be Thursday. I want you to go
off this afternoon, if you don’t very much mind, to that
parson I was telling you of—the parson at Tremnan. He
knows me and he’s a real sportsman. He must do the trick.
You can tell him, 1.30 Thursday. Then there’s the licence
to be got. I’ll see to that. I’ve been here three weeks now,
so that’s all right. Then it only remains to think about that,
I’m going to get ’em—the family, I mean—to go for an
expedition on Thursday. Mother will understand if I ask
her, and that will get them out of the way. Then we just
take a cab, you and I and Janet and Miss Minns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Minns?” broke in Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Tony, still very seriously. “The poor
woman’s frightened out of her life, and Janet’s taken her
into her confidence. We’re going to take her away with us.
She’s going to live with us. That’ll be all right. She’s got
more sense than you think. Well, we four drive out to the
church and there the thing’s done. Then we get back and
catch the three o’clock up to town. Then off to Paris that
same night; and there you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped and looked at Maradick for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only thing,” he said, “is about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About me?” Maradick looked up, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. What are we going to do about you? Of course
you can come off with us, too, if you like, but then there’s
your wife and the girls. You couldn’t do that very well, I
suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Maradick, “I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but, you know, if you’re left, why then, everybody’s
got you, so to speak—Morelli, my people, everybody.
There’s only you to turn on; you’ll have a pretty rotten
time. It isn’t fair. And even now, you know, if you’d
rather get out of it I expect I’ll manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hadn’t really seen how damned selfish it all was until
just now. I asked you to come and didn’t see it really a bit,
what it would all lead to, I mean, and especially for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked up, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy, do you suppose I, at any rate, haven’t
seen? Why, from the beginning, from that first night of
all when we talked about it, I was responsible; responsible to
your mother at any rate, and she’s the only person who really
matters. As to Morelli, he can do nothing. When I see a
girl look as Janet looked the other night, why, then it was
time some steps were taken by somebody to get her away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hand on Tony’s arm. “And besides, whatever
happened to me, do you suppose that I could ever cease
to be grateful for all that you’ve done for me, your being with
me, your showing me a new kind of life altogether? I’d be a
bit of a cur if I wasn’t ready to help you after that. Nothing
that I can do can quite repay you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, then,” said Tony. He was a little
impatient, just then, of Maradick’s approach to sentiment.
It was off the mark; it hadn’t anything at all to do with
Janet, and besides, it was all rot, anyway, to talk about
all that he’d done. He’d done nothing. But he didn’t,
in the least, want to be ungracious. “But that’s most awfully
good of you, really, and I don’t suppose, as a matter
of fact, they’ll do very much. They can’t, anyhow. I’m
over age, and I shan’t have to go to the governor for money.
Besides, it will be all right in a week or two. The governor’s
like that; I know him, and once the thing’s over he’ll get over
it, because he loathes things being uncomfortable; besides,
mother will manage him. Anyhow, are you sure you don’t
mind going off to the parson? I’d come, too, but I think it
would be safer for me on the whole to hang round here this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, Maradick didn’t mind. Maradick would like to go;
Maradick would do anything. And, as a matter of fact, he
wanted to get out and away—away from the house and the
people in it, where he could think undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left Tony and started down to the town. His brain
was still on fire with his meeting with Mrs. Lester on the
evening before. During these last three days they had had
very few opportunities of meeting, but the affair had nevertheless
advanced with extraordinary rapidity. Then, last
night, he had been alone with her, after dinner, in the garden.
It had been terribly hot and oppressive, a prelude to the
storm that came a few hours later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a breath of wind; the world might have
been of carved stone, so motionless was it. He had had her
in his arms; her hands had crept round his neck and had
pulled his head down until it rested on her breast. He had
been on fire—the world had been on fire—and he had poured
into her ear, in fierce hurried words, passion such as it seemed
to him no man had ever known before. He had told her the
old, old arguments; things that seemed to him absolutely new
and fresh. Their marriages had been, both of them, absurd.
They had been joined, each of them, to persons who did not
understand them, people who did not even care to understand
them. After all, what were marriage vows? A few words
spoken hurriedly when they could not possibly tell whether
there was even a chance of their being able to keep them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not meant to keep them. They had made
their mistake, and now they must pay for it; but it was
better to break with those bonds now, to have done with them
once and for all, than to go on for ever in hypercritical
mockery, pretending what they could not feel, acting a lie
before God and man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, if they could escape now, away from this stupid
country with its stupid conventions, away to some place
where they would be happy together for ever until death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and so on, and so on; and the leaves and the paths and the
dark sky were held together, motionless, by the iron hand of
God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then some one had in a moment interrupted them;
some fool from the hotel. Maradick’s fingers itched to be
about his throat. “What a close night! Yes, a storm must
be coming up. They’d heard very distant thunder; how
solemn the sea sounded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and so they had gone into the
hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain had ceased. The streets stretched in dreary wet
lines before him, the skies were leaden grey; from some room
the discordant jingle of a piano came down to him, a cart
bumped past him through the mud and dirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly the tower in the market-place sprung
upon him. It was literally that, a definite springing out
from all the depths of greyness and squalor behind it to meet
him. On shining days, when the sky was very blue and the
new smart hotel opposite glittered in all its splendour, the
tower put on its most sombre cloak of grey and hid itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was no time or place for it when other things could
look so brilliant, but now, in the absolutely deserted market-place,
when the cobbles glittered in the wet and the windows,
like so many stupid eyes, gave back the dead colour of the
sky, it took its rightful place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to be the one thing that mattered, with its
square and sturdy strength, its solidity that bid defiance
to all the winds and rains of the world. Puddles lay about
its feet and grey windy clouds tugged at its head, but it
stood confidently resolute, while the red hotel opposite shrunk
back, with its tawdry glitter damped and torn and dishevelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Maradick stood alone in the market-place and looked at
it, and suddenly realised it as a symbol. He might have his
room from which he looked out and saw the world, and he
held it to be good; Tony had shown him that. He might
have his freedom, so that he might step out and take the
wonderful things that he had seen; Punch had shown him
that. But he must also have—oh! he saw it so clearly—his
strength, the character to deal with it all, the resolution to
carve his own actions rather than to let his actions carve him;
and the tower had shown him that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he looked at it, he almost bowed his head before it.
Foolish to make so much of an old thing like that! Sentimental
and emotional with no atom of common-sense in it,
but it had come out to meet him just when he wanted it most.
It needed all his resolution to persuade himself that it had
not a life of its own, that it did not know, like some old,
sober, experienced friend, what danger he was running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed out into the country. Although the rain had
ceased and the grass was scenting the air with the new
fragrance that the storm had given it, the sky was dark
and overcast, grey clouds like Valkyries rushed furiously before
the wind, and the sea, through the mist, broke into
armies of white horses. As far as the eye could reach they
kept charging into the grey dun-coloured air and fell back
to give way to other furious riders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mist crept forward like live things, twisting and
turning, forming into pillars and clouds, and then rent by
the screaming wind into a thousand tatters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road was at a high level, and he could see the coast
for some miles bending round until it reached the headland;
a line of white foam stretched, with hard and clear outline,
from point to point. This was a new Cornwall to him,
this grey mysterious thing, hinting at so much, with a force
and power almost terrible in its ominous disregard of
human individuality. He had thought that the right light
for Cornwall was on a day of gold and blue, now he knew that
he had not seen half the wonder and fascination; it was here,
with this crawling foam, the sharp rocks, the screaming wind
and the turning, twisting mist, that she was rightly to be
seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind tore at his coat and beat him about the face. It
was incredible that only yesterday there should have been
heat and silence and dazzling colour. He pressed forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thought now was that he was glad Mrs. Maradick
did not know. Until this morning he had not considered
her at all. After all, she had given him a bad twenty years
of it, and she had no right to complain. Other men did it
with far less excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there had been something when she had met him
at breakfast this morning that he had not understood. She
had been almost submissive. She had spoken to him at
breakfast as she had never spoken to him in their married
life before. She had been gentle, had told Annie not to
jingle her teaspoon because it worried father, and had inquired
almost timidly what were his plans for the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had felt yesterday that he rather wanted her to see
that Mrs. Lester was fond of him; she had driven it into
him so often that he was only accepted by people as her
husband, that he had no value in himself at all except as a
payer of bills. She had even chaffed him about certain
ladies of whom she had ironically suggested that he was
enamoured. And so it had seemed in its way something
of a triumph to show her that he wasn’t merely a figurehead,
a person of no importance; that there was somebody
who found him attractive, several people, indeed. But now
he was ashamed. He had scarcely known how to answer
her when she had spoken to him so gently. Was she too
under influence of the place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, he did not know what he was going to do. He
was tired, worn out; he would not think of it at all. He
would see how things turned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of the day had changed. The mists were
still on the sea, but behind them now was the shining of the
sun, only as a faint light vaguely discerned, but the water
seemed to heave gently as though some giant had felt the
coming of the sun and was hurrying to meet it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light was held back by a wall of mist, but in places
it seemed to be about to break through, and the floor of the
sea shone with all the colours of mother of pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little church stood back from the cliff; it stood as
though it had faced a thousand years of storm and rain, as
an animal stands with its feet planted wide and its ears well
back ready for attack. Its little tower was square and its
stone was of weather-beaten grey, only the little windows
with deep blue glass caught the haze from the sea and shone
like eyes through the stone and across the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little rectory stood on the other side of the road.
It also was minute and absolutely exposed to the elements;
here lived the Rev. Mark Anstey, aged eighty-two, quite
alone except for the company of five dogs, six cats, three
pigeons, a parrot, two tame rabbits, a hedgehog and a great
many frogs, these last in a pond near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Maradick came up the road he saw the old man
standing in his garden watching the sea. The mist had
been drawn back, as a veil is drawn back by a mysterious
hand, until it lay only on the horizon. The sea was still grey,
but it hinted, as it were, at wonderful colours. You fancied
that you could see blue and gold and purple, and yet when
you looked again it was still grey. It was as though a sheet
of grey gauze had been stretched over a wonderful glittering
floor and the colours shone through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man was a magnificent figure of enormous height.
He had a great white beard that fell almost to his waist and
his snow-white hair had no covering. Three of his dogs were
at his side and the five cats sat in a row on his doorstep. He
was standing with his hands behind his back and his head up
as though to catch the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick introduced himself and stated his errand. The
old man shook him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes; come in, won’t you? Very pleased to meet
you, Mr. Maradick. Come into my study and I’ll just take
down details.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was as clear as a bell, and his eyes, blue as the
sea, looked him through and through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, this is my room. Bit of a mess, isn’t it? But a
bachelor can’t help that, you know; besides, I like a mess,
always did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever it was, it was the right kind of mess. The
fireplace was of bright blue tiles; there were books, mostly,
it seemed, theological, fishing tackle cumbered one corner,
guns another, a writing-desk took up a good deal of the room.
The old man filled the place. He really was enormous, and
he had a habit of snapping his fingers with a sharp, clicking
noise like the report of a pistol. Two deerhounds were lying
by the fireplace, and these came to meet him, putting their
noses into his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ha! Hum—where are we? Oh! yes! Sit down,
Mr. Maradick, won’t you? Oh, clear those things off the
chair—yes—let me see! Anthony Gale—Janet Morelli—what?
Morelli? How do you spell it? What? M-o-r-e—oh!
yes, thanks! Thursday—1.30. Yes, I know the boy;
going to be married, is he? Well, that’s a good thing—can’t
start breeding too young—improves the race—fill the country
with children. Married yourself, Mr. Maradick? Ah!
that’s good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick wondered whether the name, Morelli, would
seem familiar to him, but he had obviously never heard it
before. “We don’t have many weddings up in this church
here, nowadays. They don’t come this way much. Just
the people down at the cove, you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have some tea—oh,
yes! you must have some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rang the bell and a small boy with a very old face
came and received orders. “Remarkable thing, you know,”
said Mr. Anstey when the boy had gone out again. “That
boy’s twenty-three. You wouldn’t think it, now, would you?
But it’s true. Stopped growing, but he’s a good boy; rings
the bell in the church, and digs in the garden and all the rest
of it. We’ll have tea outside. It’s warm enough and it’s
going to be fine, I think. Besides, I always must have my
eyes on the sea if it’s possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had tea in the little porch over the door; the honeysuckle
was still in flower and there were still roses in the
beds, a mass of red hollyhocks at the farther end of the garden
stood out against the sky. The old man talked of Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ve met him several times; a splendid boy, a friend
of Garrick’s who’s brought him up here. Ah, you know Garrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Maradick knew Garrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s a man! God made that man all right,
even though he isn’t often inside a church. He worships in
his own kind way, you know, as most of us do, if you only
look into it. God’s more tolerant than most of us parsons,
I can tell you, and understands people a lot better, too. Not
that we parsons aren’t a pretty good lot on the whole, but
we’re a bit apt to have our eyes fixed on our little differences
and our creeds and our little quarrels when we ought to be
having our eyes on the sky. Ah, if I could get a few of those
gentlemen who are quarrelling there up in London and just
set them here in this garden in rows with that to look at!”
He waved his hand at the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hill bent at the end of the garden and disappeared,
and beyond the bend there was nothing but the sea. The
blue was beginning to steal into it in little lakes and rivers
of colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s God’s work, you know; take your atheist and
show him that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked about Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nice boy, if ever there was one. But what’s this about
marriage? Well, I suppose I mustn’t ask questions. You’re
a friend of his and you’re looking after him. But that’s a
boy who’ll never go wrong; I’d trust any woman to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Maradick got up to go. This man had impressed
him strangely; he had got that thing that Tony and Punch
had got, but he had used it in the right way. There was not
only the sentiment, the emotion of the view, there was the
strength of the tower as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick left him standing gazing at the sea. His figure
seemed to fill the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way back the sky grew clearer, and although the
sun was never actually to be seen its light was felt in the air
and over the sea. There was a freshness about everything
around him. The sheaves on the hills, the grass waving on
the moor, the sheep clustered in their pens, the hard white
clean lines of the road surrounded him with new life. He
felt suddenly as though he had been standing during these
last days in a dark, close room with the walls pressing about
him and no air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet he knew, as he neared the town, that the fascination,
the temptation was beginning to steal about him again.
As the door of the hotel closed round him, the tower, the
clear colours of the land and sky, the man standing gazing
at the sea—these things were already fading away from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had nearly finished dressing when his wife came into
his room. She talked a little, but had obviously nothing
very much to say. He was suddenly conscious that he
avoided looking at her. He busied himself over his tie, his
shirt; it was not, he told himself angrily, that he was ashamed
of facing her. After all, why should he be? All that he had
done was to kiss another woman, and most men had done that
in their time. He was no saint and, for that matter, neither
was she. Nobody was a saint; but he was uncomfortable,
most certainly uncomfortable. Looking into the glass as he
brushed his hair, he caught sight of her staring at him in a
strange way, as though she were trying to make up her mind
about something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Puzzled—puzzled—puzzled about what? Perhaps it was
just possible that she too was just discovering that she had
missed something in all these years. Perhaps she too was
suddenly wondering whether she had got everything from life
that she wanted; perhaps her mind was groping back to days
when there did seem to be other things, when there were,
most obviously, other people who had found something that
she had never even searched for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought touched him strangely. After all, what if
there was a chance of starting again? Lord! what a fool he
was to talk like that! Didn’t he know that in another two
hours’ time he would be with the other woman, his pulses
beating to a riotous tune that she, his wife, could never teach
him; you couldn’t cure the faults, the mistakes, the omissions
of twenty years in three weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner that night was of the pleasantest. Tony was at
his very best. He seemed to have recovered all his lost
spirits. That white, tense look had left his face, the strain
had gone out of his eyes; even the waiters could not keep
back their smiles at his laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They discussed the hour of departure and Tony did not
turn a hair. Mrs. Lester glanced for an instant at Maradick,
but that was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I shall have to go up on Thursday night,”
said Lester. “One’s publishers, you know, need continual
looking after, and if I don’t see them on Friday morning it
may be some time before I get a chance again. But I’ll leave
my wife in your hands, Lady Gale. I know she’ll be safe
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! we’ll look after her, Lester,” said Tony, laughing;
“won’t we, Milly? We’ll look after you all the time. I’ll
constitute myself your special knight-errant, Milly. You
shall want for nothing so long as I am there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Tony,” said Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fine enough night for them all to go into the
garden, and very soon Maradick and Mrs. Lester were alone.
It was all about him once again, the perfume that she used,
the rustle of her dress, the way that her hair brushed his
cheek. But behind it, in spite of himself, he saw his wife’s
face in the mirror, he saw Tony, he saw the tower, and he
felt the wind about his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him and put her arms about his neck; but he
put them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said almost roughly, “we’ve got to talk; this
kind of thing must be settled one way or the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, don’t be cross.” Her voice was very gentle; he
could feel her breath on his cheek. “Ah, if you knew what
I’d been suffering all day, waiting for you, looking forward,
aching for these minutes; no, you mustn’t be cruel to
me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stared in front of him, looking into the black depths
of the trees that surrounded them on every side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there’s more in it than I thought. What are we
going to do? What’s going to happen afterwards? Don’t
you see, we must be sensible about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, holding his hand. “There is no time for
that. We can be sensible afterwards. Didn’t you hear at
dinner? Fred is going away on Thursday night; we have
that, at any rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, roughly breaking away from her, “we must
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she pressed up against him. Her arm passed slowly
round his neck and her fingers touched, for a moment, his
cheek. “No; listen. Don’t you see what will happen if
we don’t take it? All our lives we’ll know that we’ve missed
it. There’s something that we might have had—some life,
some experience. At any rate we had lived once, out of
our stuffy lives, our stupid, dull humdrum. Oh! I tell you,
you mustn’t miss it! You’ll always regret, you’ll always
regret!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her whole body was pressed against his. He tried to push
her away with his hand. For a moment he thought that he
saw Tony watching him and then turning away, sadly, scornfully.
And then it swept over him like a wave. He crushed
her in his arms; for some minutes the world had stopped.
Then again he let her go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” she said, smiling and touching her dress with her
fingers. “You are dreadfully strong. I did not know how
strong. But I like it. And now Thursday night will be
ours; glorious, wonderful, never to be forgotten. I must go.
They’ll be wondering. You’d better not come back with
me. Good-night, darling!” She bent down, kissed him and
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he sat there, his hands gripping his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What sort of scum was he? He, a man?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>This</span> then was the fine new thing that Tony and Punch
had shown him. <span class='it'>This</span> the kind of world! <span class='it'>This</span> the great
experience. Life!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>No.</span> With all his soul he knew that it was not; with all
his soul he knew that the devil and all his angels were pressing
about his path—laughing, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the moon rose behind the trees and the stars danced
between the branches.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch17'>CHAPTER XVII</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MORNING AND AFTERNOON OF THE TWENTY-SEVENTH—TONY,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MARADICK, JANET, AND MISS MINNS HAVE A RIDE</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>AFTER THE WEDDING</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Lester had not the courage of her convictions.
Those convictions were based very largely on an audacious
standing up against Providence, although she herself
would never have seen it in that light. In each of her “affairs”
she went breathlessly forward, as it were on tiptoe,
with eyes staring and heart beating; wondering what would
be the dangers, gasping at possibly startling adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the real thing had never met her before. The two
or three men who had been concerned in her other experiences
had understood quite as well as she did that it was only
a game, <span class='it'>pour passer le temps</span>, and a very pleasant way of
passing it too. But this man was taking it very differently.
It was no game at all to him; he did not look as though he
could play a game if he wanted to. But it was not Maradick
who frightened her; it was herself. She had never gone so
far as this before, and now as she undressed she was suddenly
terribly frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face seemed white and ghostly in the mirror, and in
a sudden panic, she turned on all the lights. Then the blaze
frightened her and she turned them all out again, all save the
one over the mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat gazing into it, and all the dark corners of the room
seemed to gather round her like living things; only her white
face stared out of the glass. If Fred hadn’t been so horribly
humdrum, if she hadn’t known so thoroughly every inch of
him, every little trick that he had, every kind of point of
view that he ever had about anything, then this never would
have happened. Because, really, he had been a very good
husband to her, and she was really fond of him; when one
came to think of it, he had been much better than a good
many husbands she had known. She leaned back in her chair
and looked at herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had once been more than mere fondness, it had been
quite exciting; she smiled, reminiscences crowded about
her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dear old Fred!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she pulled herself up with a jerk. That, after all,
wasn’t the point; the point, the thing that mattered, was
Thursday night. Out there in the garden, when he had held
her like that, a great lawlessness had come upon her. It was
almost as though some new spirit had entered into her and
was showing her things, was teaching her emotions that she
had never been shown or learnt before. And, at that moment,
it had seemed to her the one thing worth having.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never lived before. Life was to be counted by
moments, those few golden moments that the good gods gave
to one, and if one didn’t take them, then and there, when they
were offered, why then, one had never lived at all, one might
as well never have been born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, as she sat there alone in her room, she was
realising another thing—that those moments had their consequences.
What were they going to do afterwards? What
would Maradick do? What, above all, would her own attitude
to Fred be? She began, very slowly, to realise the
truth, that the great laws are above creeds and all dogmas because
they are made from man’s necessities, not from his
superstitions. What was she going to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew quite well what she would do if she were left
there alone on Thursday night, and at the sudden thought
of it she switched off the light and plunged the room into
darkness. She lay in bed waiting for Fred to come up.
She felt suddenly very unprotected. She would ask him to
take her with him on Thursday, she would make some excuse;
he would probably be glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard him undressing in the next room. He was
whistling softly to himself; he stumbled over something and
said “Damn.” She heard him gargle as he brushed his
teeth. He hummed a song of the moment, “I wouldn’t go
home in the dark”; and then she heard him stepping across
the carpet towards the bed, softly lest he should wake her.
He got into bed and grunted with satisfaction as he curled
up into the sheets; his toe touched her foot and she shivered
suddenly because it was cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, old girl,” he said, “still awake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She didn’t answer. Then she turned slowly round towards
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fred,” she said, “I think I’ll come away with you on
Thursday after all.” But, as she said it to him, she was
suddenly afraid of his suspecting something. He would
want to know the reason. “It’s not,” she added hurriedly,
“that I’m not perfectly happy here. I’m enjoying it awfully,
it’s delightful; but, after all, there isn’t very much
point in my staying here. I don’t want to after you’re
gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was sleepy. He yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully tired, dear. We’ll talk about it to-morrow.
But anyhow, I don’t quite see the point. You won’t
want to be pottering about London with me. I’m only up
there for business—these beastly publishers,” he yawned
again. “You’d be bored, you know; much better stay here
with Lady Gale. Besides, it’s all arranged.” His voice
died off into a sleepy murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the terror seemed to gather about her in the darkness.
She saw with amazing vision. She did not want to be left;
she must not be left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fred, please—it’s important; I don’t want to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she was suddenly frightened. She had said too
much. He would want to know why she didn’t want to stay.
But he lay there silently. She was afraid that he would go
to sleep. She knew that when the morning came things
would seem different. She knew that she would persuade
herself that there was no immediate hurry. She would leave
things to settle themselves; and then. Oh! well! there
would be no question as to how things would go! She saw,
with absolute clearness that this was the moment that was
granted her. If she could only persuade him to take her
now, then she would have that at any rate afterwards to hold
herself back. She would not want to go back on her word
again. Her only feeling now was that Fred was so safe.
The thought of the evening, the garden, Maradick, filled her
now with unreasoning terror; she was in a panic lest this
minute, this opportunity, should leave her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned towards him and shook his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fred, just keep awake for a minute; really it’s important.
Really, I want to go away with you, on Thursday, not
to stay on. I don’t like the place. I shan’t a bit mind
being in London, it will be rather fun; there are lots of people
I want to see. Besides, it’s only a day or two after
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he laughed sleepily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all the fuss, old girl? I’m simply damned tired;
I am, really. We’ll talk about it to-morrow. But anyhow,
you’d better stay; it’s all arranged, and Lady Gale will think
it rather funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice trailed off. For a moment there was silence
and she heard his breathing. He was asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened furiously. Oh, well, if he didn’t care more
than that! If he couldn’t keep awake longer than that!
She dug her nails into her hand. There it was; he could go
to sleep when she was in torture. He didn’t care; the other
man! Her mind flew back to the evening again. Ah! he
would not have gone off to sleep! He would have listened—listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she lay for hours staring into the darkness, listening
to the man’s even breathing.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But there had been another example of “any wife to any
husband,” that must, for a moment, have its record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick feared, on coming into his room, that his wife
was not yet in bed. She was sitting in front of her glass
brushing her hair. She must have seen him in the mirror,
but she did not move. She looked very young, almost like
a little doll; as she sat there he had again the curious feeling
of pathos that he had known at breakfast. Absurd!
Emmy Maradick was the last person about whom anyone
need be pathetic, but nevertheless the feeling was there. He
got into bed without a word. She went on silently combing
her hair. It got on his nerves; he couldn’t take his eyes off
her. He turned his eyes away towards the wall, but slowly
they turned back again, back to the silent white figure in the
centre of the room by the shining glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly wanted to scream, to shout something at her
like “Speak, you devil!” or “don’t go on saying nothing,
you mummy, sitting still like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he did speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re late, Emmy,” he said, “I thought you’d have
been in bed.” His voice was very gentle. If only she would
stop moving that brush up and down with its almost mechanical
precision! She put the brush slowly down on the table
and turned towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “I was waiting for you, really, until you
came up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was suddenly convinced that she knew; she had probably
known all about it from the first. She was such a
clever little woman, there were very few things that she didn’t
know. He waited stupidly, dully. He wondered what she
was going to say, what she was going to propose that they
should do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But having got so far, she seemed to have nothing more
to say. She stared at the glass with wide, fixed eyes; her
cheeks were flushed, and her fingers played nervously with the
things on the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said at last, “what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to his intense surprise, she got up and came slowly
towards him; she sat on the edge of the bed whilst he watched
her, wondering, amazed. He had never seen her like that
before, and his intense curiosity at her condition killed, for
a moment, the eagerness with which he would discover how
much she knew. But her manner of taking it was surely
very strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Temper, fury, passion, even hate, that he could understand,
and that, knowing her, he would have expected, but
this strange dreamy quiet frightened him. He caught the
bed-clothes in his hands and twisted them; then he asked
again: “Well, what is it?” But when she did at last speak
she did not look at him, but stared in front of her. It was
the strangest thing in the world to see her sitting there,
speaking like that; and he had a feeling, not to be explained,
that she wasn’t there at all really, that it was some one else,
even, possibly, some strange thing that his actions of these
last few days had suddenly called forth—called forth, that
was, to punish him. He shrunk back on to his pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” her voice just went on, “it isn’t that I’ve really
anything to say; you’ll think me silly, and I’m sure I don’t
want to keep you when you want to go to sleep. But it isn’t
often that we have anything very much to say to one another;
it isn’t, at any rate, very often here. We’ve hardly, you
know, talked at all since we’ve been here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But these last few days I’ve been thinking, realising
perhaps, that it’s been my fault all these years that things
haven’t been happier.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t think I’d thought about
anyone except myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In some sort of way I hadn’t
considered you at all; I don’t quite know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused as though she expected him to say something,
but he made no sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went on: “I suppose you’ll think it foolish
of me, but I feel as though everything has been different from
the moment that we came here, from the moment that we
came to Treliss; you have been quite different, and I am
sorry if I have been so disagreeable, and I’m going to try,
going to try to be pleasanter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brought it out with a jerk, as though she were speaking
under impulse, as though something was making her
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he didn’t know what to say; he could say nothing—his
only emotion that he was angry with her, almost furious,
because she had spoken like that. It was too bad of her,
just then, after all these years. There had, at any rate, been
some justification before, or, at least, he had tried to persuade
himself that there was, in his relations with Mrs. Lester.
He had been driven by neglect, lack of sympathy, and
all the rest of it; and now, suddenly, that had been taken
away from under his feet. Oh! it was too bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then his suspicions were aroused again. It was so
unlike her to behave like that. Perhaps she was only behaving
like this in order to find out, to sound him, as it were.
Oh, yes! it was a clever move; but he couldn’t say anything
to her, the words refused to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waited, a little pathetically, there on the bed, for him
to speak; and then as nothing came, still without looking at
him, she said quietly “Good-night,” and stepped softly across
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her switch the light off, the bed-clothes rustled
for a moment, and then there was silence.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And these next two days were torture to him, the most
horrible days that he had ever known. Partly they were
horrible because of the general consciousness that something
was going to happen. Lady Gale, in obedience to Tony, had
arranged a picnic for Thursday, but “for ladies only. You
see, Mr. Lester is leaving in the afternoon, and my husband
and Rupert talk of going with him as far as Truro; my husband
has some relations there. And really, I know you and
Tony would rather go off on your own, Mr. Maradick. It
would be too boring for you. We’re only going to sit in the
sun, you know, and talk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was understood that Mr. Maradick had, as a matter of
fact, fixed up something. Yes, he had promised his day to
Tony, it being one of the last that they would have together.
They would probably go for a sail. He would like to have
come. He enjoyed the last, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was quite enough to “do” the trick. What a
picnic! Imagine! With everyone acutely conscious that
there was something “going on” just over the hill, something
that, for Lady Gale, at any rate, meant almost life and death.
Thursday began to loom very large indeed. What would
everyone be doing and thinking on Friday? Still more vital
a question, <span class='it'>where</span> would everyone be on Friday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at any rate he could picture them: the ladies—Lady
Gale, Alice Du Cane, Mrs. Lester, his wife, even poor Mrs.
Lawrence—sitting there, on the edge of the hill, silent, alert,
listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a picnic!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But their alertness, or rather their terrible eagerness to
avoid seeming alert, horrified him. They seemed to pursue
him, all five of them, during those two dreadful days with
questioning glances; only his wife, by her curious patient intentness,
as though she were waiting for the crisis to come,
frightened him most of all. The more he thought of her
strange behaviour the less he understood her. It was all so
utterly unlike her. And it was not as though she had altered
at all in other ways. He had heard her talking to other people,
he had watched her scolding the girls, and it was the same
sharp, shrill voice, the same fierce assumption that the person
she was with must necessarily be trying to “get” at her; no,
she was the same Emmy Maradick as far as the rest of the
world was concerned. But, with him, she was some one
altogether new, some one he had never seen before; and
always, through it all, that strange look of wonder and surprise.
He often knew that her eyes were upon him when he
was talking to some one else; when he talked to her himself
her eyes avoided him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Mrs. Lester, too, was so strange. During the
whole of Tuesday she avoided him altogether. He had a
few minutes with her at teatime, but there were other people
there, and she seemed anxious to get away from him, to put
the room between them. And seeing her like this, his passion
grew. He felt that whatever happened, whatever the
disaster, he must have her, once at least, in his arms again.
The memories of their other meetings lashed him like whips.
He pictured it again, the darkness, the movement of the
trees, the touch of her cheek against his hand; and then he
would feel that his wife was looking at him from somewhere
across the room. He could feel her eyes, like little gimlets,
twisting, turning into his back. And then other moods
would come, and the blackest despair. He was this kind of
man, this sort of scoundrel; he remembered once that there
had been a man at Epsom who had run away with a married
woman, a man who had been rather a friend of his. He remembered
what he had said to him, the kind of way that
he had looked at him, poor, rotten creature; and now what
was he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he could not go; he could not move. He was under
a spell. When he thought of Mrs. Lester his blood would
begin to race again. He told himself that it was the sign
of his freedom, the natural consequences of the new life that
had come to him; and then suddenly he would see that moment
when his wife, sitting forlornly on his bed, had spoken
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then on Wednesday there was a moment when Mrs.
Lester was herself again. It was only a moment, an instant
after dinner. Their lips met; he spoke of Thursday and
she smiled at him, then the others had come upon them. For
an hour or two he was on fire, then he crept miserably, like a
thief, to the room of the minstrels and sat wretchedly, hour
after hour, looking at the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day would soon dawn! Thursday! The crisis, as
it seemed to him, of the whole of his life. He saw the morn
draw faint shadows across the earth, he saw all the black trees
move like a falling wall against the stars, he felt the wind
with the odour of earth and sea brush his cheek, as he waited
for the day to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew now that it was to be no light thing; it was to
be a battle, the fiercest that he had ever waged. Two forces
were fighting over him, and one of them, before the next
night had passed, would win the day. No Good and Evil?
No God and Devil? No Heaven and Hell? Why, there
they were before his very eyes; the two camps and the field
between! And so Thursday dawned!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it came with grey mists and driving rain. The sea
was hidden; only the tops of the trees in the garden stood
disconsolately dripping above the fog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone came down shivering to breakfast, and disappointments
that seemed unjust on ordinary days were now
perfectly unbearable. If there were no letters, one was left
out in the cold, if there were a lot, they were sure to be bills.
It was certain to be smoked haddock when that was the one
thing above all others that you loathed; and, of course, there
were numbers of little draughts that crept like mice about
your feet and wandered like spiders about your hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one thing was perfectly obvious, and that was, that of
course there could be no picnic. To have five ladies sitting
desolately alone on the top of the hill, bursting with curiosity,
was melancholy enough; but to have them sitting there in
driving rain was utterly impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless some people intended to venture out. Sir
Richard and Rupert—mainly, it seemed, to show their contempt
of so plebeian a thing as rain—were still determined on
Truro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony also was going to tramp it with Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?” This from Sir Richard, who
had just decided that his third egg was as bad as the two that
he had already eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I don’t know!” said Tony lazily, “over the hills
and far away, I expect. That’s the whole fun of the thing—not
knowing. Isn’t it, Maradick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He showed no signs of a bad night. He was eating a very
hearty breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must have some idea where you are going,” persisted
Sir Richard, gloomily sniffing at his egg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I expect we’ll start out towards that old church,”
said Tony. “You know, the one on the cliff; then we’ll
strike inland, I expect. Don’t you think so, Maradick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt at all that the five ladies were extremely
glad that there was to be no picnic. Mrs. Lawrence
meant to have a really cosy day reading by the fire one of
those most delightful stories of Miss Braddon. She was
enormously interested in the literature of the early eighties;
anything later than that rather frightened her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can have a really cosy day,” said Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we shall have quite a comfortable time,” said Mrs.
Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so nice having an excuse for a fire,” said Lady
Gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do love it when one can have a fire without being
ashamed, don’t you?” said Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick gathered her two girls about her and they
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly the clock stole towards half-past eleven, when the
first move was to be made. Mr. Lester had left quite early.
He said good-bye to Maradick with great cordiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind you come and see us, often. It’s been delightful
meeting you. There’s still plenty to talk about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said good-bye to his wife with his usual rather casual
geniality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, old girl. Send me a line. Hope this weather
clears off”—and he was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been standing by the hall door. As the trap
moved down the drive she suddenly made a step forward as
though she would go out into the rain after him and call him
back. Then she stopped. She was standing on the first
step in front of the door; the mist swept about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale called from the hall: “Come in, dear, you’ll
get soaking wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned and came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Tony, as he watched the hands of the clock creep round,
it seemed perfectly incredible that the whole adventure should
simply consist in quietly walking out of the door. It ought
to begin, at any rate, with something finer than that, with an
escape, something that needed secrecy and mystery. It was
so strange that he was simply going to walk down and take
Janet; it was, after all, a very ordinary affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At quarter-past eleven he found his mother alone in her
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came up to her and kissed her. “I’m going off with
Maradick now,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered, looking him in the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I’m in for an adventure, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You trust me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, dear, perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall know all about it to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you like, dear,” she answered. She placed her
arms on his shoulders, and held him back and looked him
in the face. Then she touched his head with her hands and
said softly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t let anything or anyone come between us,
Tony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, mother,” he answered. Then suddenly he came
very close to her, put his arms round her and kissed her again
and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, old boy,” she said, and let him go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had closed the door behind him she began to cry,
but when Mrs. Lester found her quarter of an hour later
there were no signs of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick and Tony, as half-past eleven struck from the
clock at the top of the stairs, went down the steps of the
hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they came out into the garden the mists and rain swam
all about them and closed them in. The wind beat their
faces, caught their coats and lashed them against their legs,
and went scrambling away round the corners of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word! what a day!” shouted Tony. “Here’s a day
for a wedding!” He was tremendously excited. He even
thought that he liked this wind and rain, it helped on the
adventure; and then, too, there would be less people about,
but it would be a stormy drive to the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They secured a cab in the market-place. But such a cab;
was there ever another like it? It stood, for no especial
reason it seemed, there in front of the tower, with the rain
whirling round it, the wind beating at the horse’s legs and
playing fantastic tricks with the driver’s cape, which flew
about his head up and down like an angry bird. He was
the very oldest aged man Time had ever seen; his beard, a
speckly grey, fell raggedly down on to his chest, his eyes were
bleared and nearly closed, his nose, swollen to double its natural
size, was purple in colour, and when he opened his mouth
there was visible an enormous tooth, but one only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands trembled with ague as he clutched the reins
and addressed his miserable beast. The horse was a pitiful
scarecrow; its ribs, like a bent towel-rack, almost pierced the
skin; its eye was melancholy but patient. The cab itself
moved as though at any moment it would fall to pieces. The
sides of the carriage were dusty, and the wheels were thick
with mud; at every movement the windows screamed and
rattled and shook with age—the cabman, the four-wheeler
and the horse lurched together from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, there was really nothing else. Time was precious,
and it certainly couldn’t be wasted in going round to
the cab-stand at the other end of the town. On a fine day
there would have been a whole row of them in the market-place,
but in weather like this they sought better shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind whistled across the cobbles; the rain fell with
such force that it hit the stones and leaped up again. The
aged man was murmuring to himself the same words again
and again. “Eh! Lor! how the rain comes down; it’s terrible
bad for the beasts.” The tower frowned down on them
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony jumped in, there was nothing else to be done; it
rattled across the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was laughing. It all seemed to him to add to the
excitement. “Do you know,” he said, “James Stephens’s
poem? It hits it off exactly;” and he quoted:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“The driver rubbed at his nettly chin,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With a huge, loose forefinger, crooked and black,</p>
<p class='line0'>And his wobbly violent lips sucked in,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And puffed out again and hung down slack:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;One fang shone through his lop-sided smile,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In his little pouched eye flickered years of guile.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>And the horse, poor beast, it was ribbed and forked,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And its ears hung down, and its eyes were old,</p>
<p class='line0'>And its knees were knuckly, and as we talked</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It swung the stiff neck that could scarcely hold</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Its big, skinny head up—then I stepped in</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the driver climbed to his seat with a grin.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Only this old boy couldn’t climb if he were paid for it. I
wonder how he gets up to his box in the morning. I expect
they lift him, you know; his old wife and the children and
the grandchildren—a kind of ceremony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were being flung about all this time like peas in a
bladder, and Tony had to talk at the top of his voice to make
himself heard. “Anyhow he’ll get us there all right, I expect.
My word, what rain! I say, you know, I can’t in the
very least realise it. It seems most frightfully exciting, but
it’s all so easy, in a kind of way. You see I haven’t even had
to have a bag or anything, because there’ll be heaps of time
to stop in town and get things. And to-morrow morning to
see the sun rise over Paris, with Janet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were on fire with excitement. But to Maradick
this weather, this cab, seemed horrible, almost ominous. He
was flung against the side of the window, then against Tony,
then back again. He had lost his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had realised something else suddenly; he wondered
how he could have been so foolish as not to have seen it before,
and that was, that this would be probably, indeed almost
certainly, the last time that he would have Tony to himself.
The things that the boy had been to him during these weeks
beat in his head like bells, reminding him. Why, the boy
had been everything to him! And now he saw suddenly
that he had, in reality, been nothing at all to the boy. Tony’s
eyes were set on the adventure—the great adventure of life.
Maradick, and others like him, might be amusing on the
way; were of course, “good sorts,” but they could be left,
they must be left if one were to get on, and there were others,
plenty of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, in that bumping cab, Maradick suddenly realised
his age. To be “at forty” as the years go was nothing, years
did not count, but to be “at forty” in the way that he now
saw it was the great dividing line in life. He now saw that
it wasn’t for him any more to join with those who were
“making life,” that was for the young, and they would have
neither time nor patience to wait for his slower steps; he
must be content to play his part in other people’s adventures,
to act the observer, the onlooker. Those young people might
tell him that they cared, that they wanted him, but they
would soon forget, they would soon pass on until they too
were “at forty,” and, reluctantly, unwillingly, must move
over to the other camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, boy,” he said almost roughly, “this is the last bit
that we shall have together; alone, I mean. I say, don’t forget
me altogether afterwards. I want to come and see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget you!” Tony laughed. “Why never! I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then suddenly the aged man and his coach bumped
them together and then flung them apart and then bumped
them again so that no more words were possible. The cab
had turned the corner. The house, with its crooked door,
was before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hall there were lights; underneath the stairs there
was a lamp and against the wall opposite the door there were
candles. In the middle of the hall Janet was standing
waiting; she was dressed in some dark blue stuff and a little
round dark blue hat, beneath it her hair shone gloriously.
She held a bag in her hand and a small cloak over her arm.
Tony came forward with a stride and she stepped a little
way to meet him. Then he caught her in his arms, and her
head went back a little so that the light of the lamp caught
her hair and flung a halo around it. Miss Minns was in the
background in a state of quite natural agitation. It was all
very quiet and restrained. There seemed to Maradick to
fall a very beautiful silence for a moment about them. The
light, the colour, everything centred round those two, and the
world stood still. Then Tony let go and she came forward
to Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out her hand and he took it in his, and he, suddenly,
moved by some strange impulse, bent down and kissed
it. She let it lie there for a moment and then drew it back,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s splendid of you, Mr. Maradick,” she said; “without
you I don’t know what we’d have done, Tony and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she turned round to Tony and kissed him again.
There was another pause, and indeed the two children seemed
perfectly ready to stand like that for the rest of the day.
Something practical must be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we ought to be making a move,” said Maradick.
“The cab’s waiting outside and the train has to be caught,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course.” Janet broke away from Tony. “How
silly we are! I’m so sorry, Miss Minns, have you got the
bag with the toothbrush? It’s all we’ve got, you know, because
we can buy things in Paris. Oh! Paris!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a breath and stood there, her eyes staring, her
hands on her hips, her head flung back. It really was amazing
the way that she was taking it. There was no doubt
or alarm at the possible consequences of so daring a step. It
must be, Maradick thought, her ignorance of all that life
must mean to her now, all the difference that it would have
once this day was over, that saved her from fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet there was knowledge as well as courage in her
eyes, she was not altogether ignorant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Minns came forward, Miss Minns in an amazing
bonnet. It was such an amazing bonnet that Miss Minns
must positively have made it herself; it was shaped like a
square loaf and little jet beads rang little bells on it as she
moved. She was in a perfect tremble of excitement, and the
whole affair sent her mind back to the one other romantic incident
in her life—the one and only love affair. But the
really amazing discovery was that romance wasn’t over for
her yet, that she was permitted to take part in a real “affair,”
to see it through from start to finish. She was quivering
with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all got into the cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very silent drive to the church. The rain had
almost stopped. It only beat every now and again, a little
doubtfully, against the window and then went, with a little
whirl of wind, streaming away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cab went slowly, and, although it lurched from side
to side and every now and again pitched forward, as though
it would fall on its head, they were not shaken about very
badly. Janet leaned back against Tony, and he had his arm
round her. They neither of them spoke at all, but his fingers
moved very lightly over her hand and then to her cheek, and
then back to her hand again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they got on to the top of the hill and started along
the white road to the church the wind from the sea met
them and swept about them. Great dark clouds, humped
like camels, raced across the sky; the trees by the roadside,
gnarled and knotted, waved scraggy arms like so many
witches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Minns’s only remark as they neared the church was,
“I must say I should have liked a little bit of orange-blossom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get that in Paris,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aged man was told to wait with his coach until they
all came out of church again. He seemed to be quite prepared
to wait until the day of doom if necessary. He stared
drearily in front of him at the sea. To his mind, it was all
a very bad business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they were all in the church, the clergyman with the
flowing beard, his elderly boy, acting as a kind of verger and
general factotum, Miss Minns, Maradick, and there, by the
altar rails, Tony and Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very tiny church indeed, and most of the room
was taken up by an enormous box-like pew that had once
been used by “The Family”; now it was a mass of cobwebs.
Two candles had been lighted by the altar and they flung a
fitful, uncertain glow about the place and long twisting
shadows on the wall. On the altar itself was a large bowl
of white chrysanthemums, and always for the rest of his life
the sight of chrysanthemums brought back that scene to Maradick’s
memory: the blazing candles, the priest with his great
white beard, the tiny, dusty church, Miss Minns and her bonnet,
Tony splendidly erect, a smile in his eyes, and Janet
with her hair and her blue serge dress and her glance every
now and again at Tony to see whether he were still there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, there, and in a few minutes, they were married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant some little wind blew along the floor, stirred
the dust and caught the candles. They flared into a blaze,
and out of the shadows there leapt the dazzling white of the
chrysanthemums, the gold of Janet’s hair, and the blue of the
little stained-glass windows. The rain had begun again and
was beating furiously at the panes; they could hear it running
in little streams and rivers down the hill past the
church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick hid his head in his hands for an instant before
he turned away. He did not exactly want to pray, he had
not got anyone to pray to, but he felt again now, as he had
felt before in the room of the minstrels, that there was something
there, with him in the place—touching him, Good and
Evil? God and the Devil? Yes, they were there, and he
did not dare to raise his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at last he looked up again and in the shock of the
sudden light the candles seemed to swing like golden lamps
before him and the altar was a throne, and, before it, the boy
and girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, again, they were all in the old man’s study,
amongst his fishing-rods and dogs and books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid both his hands on Tony’s shoulders before he said
good-bye. Tony looked up into his face and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old man said: “I think that you will be very
happy, both of you. But take one word of advice from some
one who has lived in the world a very long time and knows
something of it, even though he has dwelt in only an obscure
corner of it. My dear, keep your Charity. That is all that
I would say to you. You have it now; keep it as your dearest
possession. Judge no one; you do not know what trouble
has been theirs, what temptation, and there will be flowers
even in the dreariest piece of ground if only we sow the seed.
And remember that there are many very lonely people in the
world. Give them some of your vitality and happiness and
you will do well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Minns, who had been sniffing through the most of the
service, very nearly broke down altogether at this point. And
then suddenly some one remembered the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Tony. “My word, it’s half-past two. And the
train’s quarter-past three. Everything’s up if we miss it.
We must be off; we’ll only just do it as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the aged man sitting in a pool of water on the
box. Water dripped from the legs of the trembling horse.
The raindrops, as though possessed of a devil, leaped off the
roof of the cab like peas from a catapult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony tried to impress the driver with the fact that there
was no time to lose, but he only shook his head dolefully.
They moved slowly round the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there began the most wonderful drive that man or
horse had ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they moved slowly. The road was, by this time,
thick with mud, and there were little trenches of water on
both sides. They bumped along this for a little way. And
then suddenly the aged man became seized, as it were, by a
devil. They were on the top of the hill; the wind blew right
across him, the rain lashed him to the skin. Suddenly he
lifted up his voice and sang. It was the sailor’s chanty that
Maradick had heard on the first day of his coming to Treliss;
but now, through the closed windows of the cab, it seemed
to reach them in a shrill scream, like some gull above their
heads in the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild exultation entered into the heart of the ancient man.
He seemed to be seized by the Furies. He lashed his horse
wildly, the beast with all its cranky legs and heaving ribs,
darted madly forward, and the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancient man might have seemed, had there been a
watcher to note, the very spirit of the moor. His eyes were
staring, his arms were raised aloft; and so they went, bumping,
jolting, tumbling along the white road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the cab there was confusion. At the first movement
Miss Minns had been flung violently into Maradick’s
lap. At first he clutched her wildly. The bugles on her
bonnet hit him sharply in the eyes, the nose, the chin. She
pinched his arm in the excitement of the moment. Then she
recovered herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Mr. Maradick!” she began, “I——” but, in a second,
she was seized again and hurled against the door, so that
Tony had to clutch her by the skirt lest the boards should
give and she should be hurled out into the road. But the
pace of the cab grew faster and faster. They were now all
four of them hurled violently from one side of the vehicle
to the other. First forward, then backwards, then on both
sides at once, then all in a tangled heap together in the middle;
and the ancient man on the top of the box, the water
dripping from his hat in a torrent, screamed his song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then terror suddenly entered into them all. It seemed
to strike them all at the same moment that there was danger.
Maradick suddenly was afraid. He was bruised, his collar
was torn, he ached in every limb. He had a curious impulse
to seize Miss Minns and tear her to pieces, he was wild with
rage that she should be allowed to hit and strike him like
that. He began to mutter furiously. And the others felt
it too. Janet was nearly in tears; she clung to Tony and
murmured, “Oh! stop him! stop him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Tony, too. He cried, “We must get out of this! We
must get out of this!” and he dragged furiously at the windows,
but they would not move; and then his hand broke
through the pane, and it began to bleed, there was blood on
the floor of the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they did not know that it was the place that was
casting them out. They were going back to their cities, to
their disciplined places, to their streets and solemn houses,
their inventions, their rails and lines and ordered lives; and
so the place would cast them out. It would have its last wild
game with them. The ancient man gave a last shrill scream
and was silent. The horse relapsed into a shamble; they
were in the dark, solemn streets. They climbed the hill to
the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They began to straighten themselves, and already to forget
that it had been, in the least, terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” said Tony, “it was probably a good thing that
we came at that pace. We might have missed the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He helped Janet to tidy herself. Miss Minns was profuse
in her apologies: “Really, Mr. Maradick, I don’t know what
you can have thought of me. Really, it was most immodest;
and I am afraid that I bumped you rather awkwardly.
It was most——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stopped her and assured her that it was all right.
He was thinking, as they climbed the hill, that in another
quarter of an hour they would both be gone, gone out of his
life altogether probably. There would be nothing left for
him beyond his explanations; his clearing up of the bits, as
it were, and Mrs. Lester. But he would not think of her
now; he put her resolutely from him for the moment. The
thought of her seemed desecration when these two children
were with him—something as pure and beautiful as anything
that the world could show. He would think of her afterwards,
when they had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he looked at them a great pang of envy cut him
like a knife. Ah! that was what life meant! To have some
one to whom you were the chief thing in the world, some one
who was also the chief thing to you!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he? Here, at forty, he had got nothing but a cheque
book and a decent tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got out of the cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was ten minutes before the train left. It was there,
waiting. Tony went to get the tickets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet suddenly put her hand on Maradick’s arm and
looked up into his face:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Maradick,” she said, “I haven’t been able, I haven’t
had a chance to say very much to you about all that Tony and
I owe you. But I feel it; indeed, indeed I do. And I will
never, never forget it. Wherever Tony and I are there will
always be a place for you if you want one. You won’t forget
that, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” said Maradick, and he took her hand for a
moment and pressed it. Then suddenly his heart stopped
beating. The station seemed for a moment to be pressed
together, so that the platform and the roof met and the bookstall
and the people dotted about disappeared altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard and Rupert were walking slowly towards them
down the platform. There was no question about it at all.
They had obviously just arrived from Truro and Rupert was
staring in his usual aimless fashion in front of him. There
was simply no time to lose. They were threatened with disaster,
for Tony had not come back from the ticket-office and
might tumble upon his father at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick seized Janet by the arm and dragged her back
into the refreshment room. “Quick,” he said, “there isn’t
a moment to lose—Tony’s father. You and Miss Minns must
get in by yourselves; trust to luck!” In a moment she had
grasped the situation. Her cheeks were a little flushed, but
she gave him a hurried smile and then joined Miss Minns.
Together they walked quietly down the platform and took
their seats in a first-class carriage at the other end of the
train. Janet was perfectly self-possessed as she passed Sir
Richard. There was no question that this distinguished-looking
gentleman must be Tony’s father, and she must have
felt a very natural curiosity to see what he looked like; she
gave him one sharp glance and then bent down in what was
apparently an earnest conversation with Miss Minns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Rupert saw Maradick. “Hullo! there’s Maradick!”
He came forward slowly; but he smiled a little in
a rather weary manner. He liked Maradick. “What a
day! Yes, Truro had been awful! All sorts of dreadful
people dripping wet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Maradick had been a tramp in the rain with Tony.
Tony was just asking for a parcel that he was expecting;
yes, they’d got very wet and were quite ready for tea! Ah!
there was Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick gazed at him in agony as he came out of the
ticket office. Would he give a start and flush with surprise
when he saw them? Would he look round vaguely and wildly
for Janet? Would he turn tail and flee?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did none of these things. He walked towards them
as though the one thing that he had really expected to see,
there on the platform, was his father. There was a little
smile at the corners of his mouth and his eyes were shining
especially brightly, but he sauntered quite casually down the
platform, as though he hadn’t the least idea that the train
was going off in another five minutes, and that Janet was
close at hand somewhere and might appear at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, governor! Rupert! Who’d have thought of seeing
you here? I suppose the weather sent you back. Maradick
and I have been getting pretty soaked out there on the
hill. But one thing is that it sends you in to a fire with
some relish. I’m after a rotten old parcel that Briggs was
sending me—some books. He says it ought to have come,
but I can’t get any news of it here. We’ll follow you up to
the hotel to tea in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rupert seemed inclined to stay and chat. “Oh! we’ll
come on with you; we’re in no particular hurry, are we, governor?
I say, that was a damned pretty girl that passed
just now; girl in blue. Did you see her, Maradick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, Maradick hadn’t seen her. In blue? No, he hadn’t
noticed. The situation was beginning to get on his nerves.
He was far more agitated than Tony. What were they to
do? The guard was passing down the platform looking at
tickets. Doors were beginning to be banged. A great many
people were hurriedly giving a great many messages that
had already been given a great many times before. What
was to be done? To his excited fancy it almost seemed as
though Sir Richard was perfectly aware of the whole business.
He thought his silence saturnine; surely there was a
malicious twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Rupert was saying, “there she was walking down
Lemon Street, dontcher know, with her waterproof thing
flapping behind her in the most <span class='it'>absurd</span>——” The doors
were all banged; the guard looked down the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Sir Richard moved. “I’m damned cold; wet
things.” He nodded curtly to Maradick. “See you later,
Mr. Maradick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved slowly away; they turned the corner and at
the same instant the train began to move. Tony snatched
at Maradick’s hand and then made a wild leap across the
platform. The train was moving quite fast now; he made a
clutch at one of the carriages. Two porters rushed forward
shouting, but he had the handle of the door. He flung it
open; for a sickening instant he stood swaying on the board;
it seemed as though he would be swept back. Then some one
pulled him in. He lurched forward and disappeared; the
door was closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lot of little papers rose in a little cloud of dust into the
air. They whirled to and fro. A little wind passed along
the platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick turned round and walked slowly away.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>VISIT TO MORELLI</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he came out of the station and looked at the little road
that ran down the hill, at the grey banks of cloud, at the
white and grey valley of the sea, he felt curiously, uncannily
alone. It was as though he had suddenly, through some unknown,
mysterious agency been transported into a new land,
a country that no one ever found before. He walked the
hill with the cautious adventurous sense of surprise that
some explorer might have had; he was alone in the world of
ghosts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to the bottom of the road he stopped and
tried to collect his thoughts. Where was he? What was he
going to do? What were the thoughts that were hovering,
like birds of prey, about his head, waiting for the moment
of descent to come? He stood there quite stupidly, as though
his brain had been suddenly swept clear of all thought; it
was an empty, desolate room. Everything was empty, desolate.
Two plane trees waved mournfully; there were little
puddles of rain-water at his feet reflecting the dismal grey
of the sky; a very old bent woman in a black cloak hobbled
slowly up the hill. Then suddenly his brain was alive again,
suddenly he knew. Tony was gone. Tony was gone and he
must see people and explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of the explanations troubled him very little;
none of those other people really mattered. They couldn’t
do very much; they could only say things. No, they didn’t
matter. He didn’t mind about them, or indeed about anyone
else in the world except Tony. He saw now a thousand
little things that Tony had done, ways that Tony had stood,
things that Tony had said, little tricks that he had; and now
he had gone away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things could never be quite the same again. Tony had
got some one else now. Everyone had got some one else,
some one who especially belonged to them; he saw the world
as a place where everyone—murderer, priest, king, prostitute—had
his companion, and only he, Maradick, was alone.
He had been rather proud of being alone before; he had
rather liked to feel that he was quite independent, that it
didn’t matter if people died or forgot, because he could get
on as well by himself! What a fool he had been! Why,
that was simply the only thing worth having, relationships
with other people, intimacy, affection, giving anything that
you had to some one else, taking something in return from
them. Oh! he saw that now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been walking vaguely, without thought or purpose.
Now he saw that his feet had led him back into the town and
that he was in the market-place, facing once more the town.
He was determined not to go back to the hotel until he had
seen Morelli, and that he could not do before the evening;
but that would be the next thing. Meanwhile he would walk—no
matter where—but he would get on to the road, into
the air, and try and straighten out all the tangled state of
things that his mind was in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he stood and looked at the tower. It gave
him again that sense of strength and comfort. He was,
after all, not quite alone, whilst the world was the place that
it was. Stocks and stones had more of a voice, more of a
personal vital activity than most people knew. But he knew!
He had known ever since he came to this strange town,
this place where every tree and house and hill seemed to be
alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, with the thought of the place, Mrs. Lester came
back to him. He had forgotten her when he was thinking
of Tony. But now that Tony was gone, now that that was,
in a way, over, the other question suddenly stepped forward.
Mrs. Lester with her smile, her arms, the curve of her neck,
the scent that she used, the way that her eyes climbed, as it
were, slowly up to his just before she kissed him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs.
Lester .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it must be decided before to-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started walking furiously, and soon he was out on
the high road that ran above the sea. The rain had stopped;
the sun was not actually shining, but there was a light
through the heavy clouds as though it were not very far
away, and the glints of blue and gold, not actually seen, but,
as it were, trembling on the edge of visible appearance,
seemed to strike the air. Everything shone and glittered
with the rain. The green of trees and fields was so bright
against the grey of sea and sky that it was almost dazzling;
its brightness was unnatural, even a little cruel. And now
he was caught up in the very heat of conflict. The battle
seemed suddenly to have burst upon him, as though there
were in reality two visible forces fighting for the possession
of his soul. At one moment he seemed calm, resolute; Tony,
Janet, his wife (and this was curious, because a few days
before she would not have mattered at all), Punch, the tower,
all kinds of queer bits of things, impressions, thoughts, and
above all, a consciousness of some outside power fighting for
him—all these things determined him. He would see Mrs.
Lester to-night and would tell her that there must be nothing
more; they should be friends, good friends, but there must
be no more of that dangerous sentiment, one never knew
where it might go. And after all, laws were meant to be
kept. A man wasn’t a man at all if he could injure a woman
in that sort of way. And then he had been Lester’s friend.
How could he dishonour his wife?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly it came from the other side, fierce,
hot, wild, so that his heart began to beat furiously, his eyes
were dim. He only saw her, all the rest of the world was
swept away. They should have this one adventure, they <span class='it'>must</span>
have their one adventure. After all they were no longer children.
They had neither of them known what life was before;
let them live it now, their great experience. If they
missed it now they would regret it all their lives. They
would look back on the things that they might have done, the
things that they might have known, and see that they had
passed it all simply because they had not been brave enough,
because they had been afraid of convention, of old musty
laws that had been made thousands of years ago for other
people, people far less civilised, people who needed rules.
And then the thought of her grew upon him—details, the
sense of holding her, keeping her; and then, for an instant, he
was primitive, wild, so that he would have done anything to
seize her in the face of all the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it passed; the spirit left him, and again he was miserable,
wretched, penitent. He was that sort of man, a traitor
to his wife, to his friends, to everything that was decent. He
was walking furiously, his hair was blown by the wind, his
eyes stared in front of him, and the early dusk of a grey
day began to creep about his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It all came to this. Was there one ethical code for the
world, or must individuals make each their law for their individual
case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were certain obvious things, such as doing harm to
your neighbours, lying, cruelty, that was bad for the community
and so must be forbidden to the individual; but take
an instance of something in which you harmed no one, did
indeed harm yourself by denying it, was that a sin even if
the general law forbade it? What were a man’s instincts for?
Why was he placed so carefully in the midst of his wonderful
adventurous life if he were forbidden to know anything of
it? Why these mists? This line of marble foam far below
him? This hard black edge of the rocks against the sky?
It was all strong, remorseless, inevitable; and he by this
namby-pamby kind of virtue was going contrary to nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let the wind beat about his face as he watched the
mists in great waves and with encircling arms sweep about
the cove. There came to him as he watched, suddenly, some
lines from end of “To Paradise.” He could not remember
them exactly, but they had been something like this:</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>To Tressiter, as to every other human being, there had come suddenly
his time of revelation, his moment in which he was to see without
any assistance from tradition, without any reference to things or persons
of the past. He beheld suddenly with the vision of some one new-born,
and through his brain and body into the locked recesses of his soul
there passed the elemental passions and movements of the world that
had swayed creation from the beginning. The great volume of the
winds, the tireless beating of waves upon countless shores, the silent
waters of innumerable rivers, the shining flanks of a thousand cattle
upon moorlands that stretch without horizon to the end of time—it
was these things rather than any little acts of civilisation that some
few hundred years had seen that chimed now with the new life that
was his. He had never seen before, he had never known before. He
saw now with unprejudiced eyes, he knew now with a knowledge that
discounted all man-made laws and went, like a child, back to Mother
Earth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But with this new knowledge came also its dangers. Because
some laws seemed now of none effect it did not mean that there
must be no laws at all. That way was shipwreck. Only, out of this
new strength, this new clarity of vision, he must make his strength,
his restraint, his discipline for himself, and so pass, a new man, down
the other side of the hill.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is the “middle-age” that comes to
every man. It has nothing to do with years, but it is the great Rubicon
of life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And so Lester. Fine talk and big words, and a little
ludicrous, perhaps, if one knew what Lester was, but there
was something in it. Oh! yes! there was something in it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now this time, this “middle-age,” had come upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found that his steps had led him back again to the
little church where he had been already that day. He
thought that it might be a good place to sit and think things
out, quiet and retired and in shelter, if the rain came on
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dusk was creeping down the little lane, so that the
depths of it were hidden and black; but above the dark
clumps of trees the sky had begun to break into the faintest,
palest blue. Some bird rejoiced at this return of colour
and was singing in the heart of the lane; from the earth rose
the sweet clean smell that the rain leaves. From behind the
little blue windows of the church shone a pale yellow light,
of the same pallor as the faint blue of the sky, seeming in
some intimate, friendly way, to re-echo it. The body of the
church stood out grey-white against the surrounding mists.
It seemed to Maradick (and this showed the way that he now
credited everything with vitality) to be bending forward a
little and listening to the very distant beating of the sea; its
windows were golden eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights seemed to prophesy company, and so he was
surprised, on pushing the door softly back and entering, to
find that there was no one there. But there were two large
candles on the altar, and they waved towards him a little
with the draught from the door as though to greet him.
The church seemed larger now in the half light. The great
box-like family pew was lost in the dark corners by the
walls; it seemed to stretch away into infinite space. The
other seats had an air of conscious waiting for some ceremony.
On one of them was still an open prayer-book, open at the
marriage service, that had been left there that afternoon.
And at the sight of it the memories of Tony and Janet came
back to him with a rush, so that they seemed to be there
with him. Already it seemed a very, very long time since
they had gone, another lifetime almost. And now, as he
thought of it, perhaps, after all, it was better that they had
gone like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought over the whole affair from the beginning. The
first evening in Treliss, that first night when he had
quarrelled with her, and then there had been Tony. That
dated the change in him. But he could not remember when
he had first noticed anything in her. There had been the
picnic, the evening in their room when he had nearly lost
control of himself and shaken her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, it was after
that. That placed it. Well, then, it was only, after all,
because he had shown himself firm, because, for once, he
had made her afraid of him. Because, too, no doubt, she
had noticed that people paid him attention. For the first
time in their married life he had become “somebody,” and
that perhaps had opened her eyes. But then there had been
that curious moment the other night when she had spoken
to him. That had been extraordinarily unpleasant. He
could feel again his uncomfortable sensation of helplessness,
of not in the least knowing how to deal with her. That was
the new Mrs. Maradick. He had therefore some one quite
new to reckon with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he saw suddenly, there in the church, the right
thing to do. It was to go back. To go back to Epsom, to
go back to his wife, to go back to the girls. He saw that she,
Mrs. Maradick, in her own way, had been touched by the
Admonitus Locorum—not that he put it that way; he called
it the “rum place” or “the absurd town.” She was going
to try (she had herself told him so) to be better, more
obliging. He could see her now, sitting there on the end of
the bed, looking at him so pathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadows gathered about the church, creeping along
the floor and blotting out the blue light from the windows,
and only there was a glow by the altar where the candles
seemed to increase in size, and their light, like a feathery
golden mist, hung in circles until it lost itself in the dusky
roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stared in front of him, seeing simply the two
women, one on each side of him. He had forgotten everything
else. They stood there waiting for him to make his
choice. It was the parting of the ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly he fell asleep. He did not know that
his eyes closed; he seemed to be still stupidly staring at the
two candles and the rings that they made, and the way that
the altar seemed to slope down in front of him like the dim
grey side of a hill. And it was a hill. He could see it
stretch in front of him, up into the air, until the heights of
it were lost. At the foot of the hill ran a stream, blue in the
half-light, and in front of the stream a green plain stretching
to his feet. Along the stream were great banks of rushes,
green and brown, and away to the right and left were brown
cliffs running sheer down into the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then in his dream he suddenly realised that he had
seen the place before. He knew that beyond the plain there
should be a high white road leading to a town, that below the
cliffs there was a cove with a white sandy bay; he knew the
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And people approached. He could not see their faces,
and they seemed in that half light in which the blue hills
and the blue river mingled in the grey of the dusk to be
shadows such as a light casts on a screen. They were singing
very softly and moving slowly across the plain. Then they
passed away and there was silence again, only a little wind
went rustling down the hill and the rushes all quivered for an
instant. Then the rushes were parted, and a face looked out
from between them and looked at Maradick and smiled. And
Maradick recognised the smile. He had seen it for the first
time in a public-house, thick with smoke, noisy with drinking
and laughter. He could see it all again; the little man
in brown suddenly at his table, and then that delightful
charming laugh unlike anything else in the world—Morelli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this figure was naked, his feet were goats’ feet and
on his head were horns; his body was brown and hairy and
in his hand was a pipe. He began to play and slowly the
shadowy figures came back again and gathered about him.
They began to dance to his playing moving slowly in the
half-light so that at times they seemed only mist; and a little
moon like a golden eye came out and watched them and
touched the tops of the blue hills with flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick woke. His head had slipped forward on to the
seat in front of him. He suddenly felt dreadfully tired;
every limb in his body seemed to ache, but he was cold and
the seat was very hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he was suddenly aware that there was some one
else in the church. Over by the altar some one was kneeling,
and very faintly there came to him the words of a prayer.
“Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thy will be done, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as it is in Heaven.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lead
us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” It
was the old clergyman, the old clergyman with the white
beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick sat motionless in his seat. He made no movement,
but he was praying, praying furiously. He was praying
to no God that had a name, but to the powers of all
honour, of all charity, of all goodness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Love was the ultimate test, the test of everything. He
knew now, with a clearness that seemed to dismiss all the
shadows that had lingered for days about him, that he had
never loved Mrs. Lester. It was the cry of sensuality, the
call of the beast; it was lust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deliver us from evil.” He said it again and again, his
hands clenched, his eyes staring, gazing at the altar. The
powers of evil seemed to be all about him; he felt that if he
did not cling with all his strength to that prayer, he was
lost. The vision of Mrs. Lester returned to him. She
seemed to get between him and the old man at the altar. He
tried to look beyond her, but she was there, appealing, holding
out her arms to him. Then she was nearer to him, quite
close, he could feel her breath on his cheek; and then again,
with all the moral force that was in him, he pushed her
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he seemed to lie for a long time in a strange lassitude.
He was still sitting forward with his hands pressed
tightly together, his eyes fixed on the altar, but his brain
seemed to have ceased to work. He had that sensation of
suddenly standing outside and above himself. He saw Maradick
sitting there, he saw the dusky church and the dim gold
light over the altar, and outside the sweep of the plain and
the dark plunging sea; and he was above and beyond it all.
He wondered a little that that man could be so troubled about
so small an affair. He wondered and then pitied him.
What a perspective he must have, poor thing, to fancy that
his struggles were of so vast an importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw him as a baby, a boy, a man—stolid, stupid self-centred,
ignorant. Oh! so dull a soul! such a lump of clay,
just filling space as a wall fills it; but no use, with no share
at all in the music that was on every side of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, because for an instant the flame has descended
upon him and his eyes have been opened, he rushes at once
to take refuge in his body. He is afraid of his soul, the light
of it hurts him, he cowers in his dark corner groping for his
food, wanting his sensuality to be satisfied; and the little
spark that has been kindled is nearly out, in a moment it
will be gone, because he did not know what to do with it, and
the last state of that man is worse than the first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And slowly he came back to himself. The candles had
been extinguished. The church was quite dark. Only a
star shone through the little window and some late bird was
singing. He gathered himself together. It must be late and
he must see Morelli. He stumbled out of the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew as he faced the wind and the night air that in
some obscure way, as yet only very vaguely realised, he had
won the moral victory over himself. He had no doubt about
what he must do; he had no doubt at all about the kind of
life that he must lead afterwards. He saw that he had been
given something very precious to keep—his <span class='it'>vie sacré</span>, as it
were—and he knew that everyone had this <span class='it'>vie sacré</span> somewhere,
that it was something that they never talked about,
something that they kept very closely hidden, and that it was
when they had soiled it, or hurt it, or even perhaps for a time
lost it, that they were unhappy and saw life miserably and
distrusted their fellow beings. He had never had it before;
but he had got it now, his precious golden box, and it would
make all life a new thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was still his body. He had never felt so strong
in his life before; the blood raced through his veins, he
felt as though he would like to strip himself naked and fight
and battle with anything furious and strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sense of weariness had left him; he felt that he must
have some vent for his strength immediately or he would
commit some crime. For a few minutes he stood there and
let the wind blow about his forehead. The storm had passed
away. The sky was a very dark blue, and the stars had a
wind-blown, misty look, as they often have after a storm.
Their gold light was a little watery, as though they had all
been dipped in some mysterious lake somewhere in the hills of
heaven before they were out in the sky. In spite of the wind
there was a great silence, and the bird on some dark wind-bent
tree continued to sing. The trees on either side of the
lane rose, dark walls, against the sky. Then in the distance
there were cries, at first vague and incoherent, almost uncanny,
and then, coming down the lane, he heard the bleating
of innumerable sheep. They passed him, their bodies mysteriously
white against the dark hedges; they pressed upon
each other and their cries came curiously to him, hitting the
silence as a ball hits a board; there were very many of them
and their feet pattered away into distance. They seemed to
him like all the confused and dark thoughts that had surrounded
him all these weeks, but that he had now driven
away. His head was extraordinarily clear; he felt as though
he had come out of a long sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights were beginning to come out in the town as he
entered it. It must be, he thought, about eight o’clock, and
Morelli had probably returned from Truro. It had not occurred
to him until now to think of what he was going to say
to Morelli. After all, there wasn’t really very much to say,
simply that his daughter was gone and that she would never
come back again, and that he, Maradick, had helped her to
go. It hadn’t occurred to him until now to consider how
Morelli would probably take his share in it. He wouldn’t
like it, of course; there would probably be some unpleasantness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Morelli was undoubtedly a queer person. Tony
was a very healthy normal boy, not at all given to unnecessary
terror, but he had been frightened by Morelli. And
then there were a host of little things, none of them amounting
to anything in themselves, but taken together—oh yes!
the man was queer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street was quite empty; the lamplighter had not yet
reached that part of the town and the top of the hill was lost
in darkness. Maradick found the bell and rang it, and even
as he did so a curious feeling of uneasiness began to creep
over him. He, suddenly and quite unconsciously, wanted
to run away. He began to imagine that there was something
waiting for him on the other side of the door, and when
it actually opened and showed him only Lucy, the little
maid-of-all-work, he almost started with surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; they’re all out. I don’t know when Miss Janet
will be back, I’m sure. I’m expecting the master any moment,
sir.” She seemed, Maradick thought, a little frightened.
“I don’t know, I’m sure, sir, about Miss Janet; she
said nothing about dinner, sir. I’ve been alone.” She
stopped and twisted her apron in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick looked down the street, then he turned back and
looked past her into the hall. “Mr. Morelli told me that
he would be back about now,” he said; “I promised to
wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood aside to let him enter the hall. She was obviously
relieved that there was some one else in the house. She
was even inclined to be a little confidential. “That kitchen,”
she said and stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” he said, standing in the hall and looking at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it fairly gives you the creeps. Being alone all
day down in the basement too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” There was a little
choke in her voice and her face was very white in the darkness.
She was quite a child and not very tidy; pathetic,
Maradick thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “your master will be back in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, and it’s all dark, sir. I’ll light the lamp upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way with a candle. He followed her up the
stairs, and his uneasiness seemed to increase with every step
that he took. He had a strange consciousness that Morelli had
really returned and that he was waiting for him somewhere in
the darkness. The stairs curved, and he could see the very
faint light of the higher landing above him; the candle
that the girl carried flung their two heads on to the wall,
gigantic, absurd. His hair seemed to stand up in the shadow
like a forest and his nose was hooked like an elephant’s
trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lit the lamp in the sitting-room and then stood with the
candle by the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you couldn’t tell me, sir,” she said timidly,
“when Miss Janet is likely—what time she’ll be in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your master will probably be able to tell you,” said
Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy was inclined for conversation. “It’s funny, sir,”
she said, “what difference Miss Janet makes about the house,
comin’ in and goin’ out. You couldn’t want a better mistress;
but if it weren’t for ’er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must be seein’ to things
downstairs.” She hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was quiet save for the ticking of the clock. The
little blue tiles of the fireplace shone under the lamp, the
china plates round the wall made eyes at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sitting straight up in his chair listening. The
uneasiness that he had felt at first would soon, if he did not
keep it in check, grow into terror. There was no reason,
no cause that he could in the least define, but he felt as
though things were happening outside the door. He didn’t
know what sort of things, but he fancied that by listening
very hard he could hear soft footsteps, whispers, and a noise
like the rustling of carpets. The ticking of the clock grew
louder and louder, and to forget it he flung up the window so
that he could hear the noises of the town. But there weren’t
any noises; only, very far away, some cat was howling. The
night was now very dark; the stars seemed to have disappeared;
the wind made the lamp flare. He closed the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same moment the door opened and he saw Morelli
standing there smiling at him. It was the same charming
smile, the trusting, confiding laugh of a child; the merry
twinkle in the eyes, taking the whole world as a delightful,
delicious joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Maradick!” He seemed surprised, and came forward
holding out his hand. “I’m delighted! I hope you
haven’t been waiting long. But why is Janet not entertaining
you? She’s only upstairs, I expect. I’ll call her.”
He moved back towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Morelli isn’t in,” Maradick said slowly. He was
standing up and resting one hand on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Your servant told me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted to say more. He wanted to give his message
at once and go, but his tongue seemed tied. He sat down,
leaning both his arms on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morelli laughed. “Oh well, I expect she’s out with Minns
somewhere—walking, I suppose. They’re often late; but
we’ll wait supper a little if you don’t mind. We’ll give them
ten minutes. Well, how’s young Gale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing him like this, it was almost impossible to reconcile
him with all the absurdly uncouth ideas that Maradick had
had of him. But the uncanny feeling of there being some one
outside the door was still with him; he had a foolish impulse
to ask Morelli to open it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he leant across the table and looked Morelli in the
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I came to tell you. Young Gale has gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone? What, with his people? I’m sorry. I liked
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Not with his people. He was married to your
daughter at two o’clock this afternoon. They have gone to
London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was absolute silence. Morelli didn’t move. He
was sitting now on the opposite side of the table facing Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter has gone to London with Gale?” he said
very slowly. The smile had died away from his face and
his eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. They were married to-day. They have gone to
London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet!” He called her name softly as though she were
in the next room. “Janet!” He waited as though he expected
an answer, and then suddenly he burst into tears. His
head fell forward between his arms on to the table; his
shoulders shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick watched him. It was the most desolate thing
in the world; he felt the most utter cad. If it had been
possible he would have, at that moment, brought Janet and
Tony back by main force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he muttered, “I’m awfully sorry.” He stopped.
There was nothing to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly Morelli looked up. The tears seemed to
have vanished, but his eyes were shining with extraordinary
brilliance. His hands, with their long white fingers, were
bending over the table; his upper lip seemed to have curled
back like the mouth of a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Maradick very intently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw them married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw them leave for London?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have helped them all this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that they ought to marry; I was fond of both
of them. I wanted them to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I will kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said it without moving; his face seemed to grow more
like a beast’s at every moment. His hands stretched across
the table; the long fingers were like snakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go.” Maradick got up. Panic was about him
again. He felt that he ought to make some kind of defence
of what he had done, but the words would not come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see, afterwards, that what I did was best. It
was really the best. We will talk again about it, when you
feel calmer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved towards the door; but Morelli was coming towards
him with his head thrust forward, his back a little
bent, his hands hanging, curved, in mid-air, and he was smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to kill you, here and now,” he said. “It
is not a very terrible affair. It will not be very long. You
can’t escape; but it is not because you have done this or that,
it is not for anything that you have done. It is only because
you are so stupid, so dreadfully stupid. There are others
like you, and I hate you all, you fools. You do not understand
anything—what I am or who I am, or the world—nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick said nothing. The terror that had once seized
Tony was about him now like a cloud; the thing that was
approaching him was not a man, but something impure, unclean.
It was exactly as though he were being slowly let
down into a dungeon full of creeping snakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His breath was coming with difficulty. He felt stifled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must let me out,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, I will throw you out, later. Now, you are here.
That boy understood a little, and that girl too. They were
young, they were alive, they were part of me; I loved to
have them about me. Do you suppose that I care whether
they are married; what is that to me? But they are gone.
You with your blundering, you fat fool, you have done that;
and now I will play with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick, suddenly feeling that if he did not move soon he
would be unable to move at all, stumbled for the door. In
an instant Morelli was upon him. His hand hung for an
instant above Maradick like a whip in the air, then it fastened
on his arm. It passed up to Maradick’s neck; his other hand
was round his waist, his head was flung back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then curiously, with the touch of the other man’s hand
Maradick’s strength returned. He was himself again; his
muscles grew taut and firm. He knew at once that it was
a case of life and death. The other man’s fingers seemed to
grip his neck like steel; already they were pressing into the
flesh. He shot out his arm and caught Morelli’s neck, but it
was like gripping iron, his hand seemed to slip away. Then
Morelli’s hand suddenly dug into Maradick’s shoulder-bone.
It turned about there like a gimlet. Suddenly something
seemed to give, and a hot burning pain twisted inside his
flesh as an animal twists in its burrow. They swayed backwards
and forwards in the middle of the room. Maradick
pushed the other body slowly back and, with a crash, it met
the table. The thing fell, and the lamp flamed for an instant
to the ceiling and then was on the floor in a thousand pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the lamp fell the darkness seemed to leap like a
wall out of the ground. It fell all about them; it pressed
upon them, and the floor heaved to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had turned round and round, so that Maradick was
confused and could not remember where the door was. Then
the other man’s hand was pressing on his throat so that he was
already beginning to be stifled; then he felt that he was dizzy.
He was swimming on a sea, lights flashed in and out of the
darkness; the window made a grey square, and through this
there seemed to creep innumerable green lizards—small with
burning eyes; they crawled over the floor towards him. He
began to whimper, “No, Morelli, please .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
my God!” His shoulder burnt like fire; his brain began to
reel so that he fancied that there were many people there
crushing him. Then he knew that Morelli was slowly pressing
him back. One hand was about his neck, but the other had
crept in through his shirt and had touched the skin. Maradick
felt the fingers pressing over his chest. Then the fingers
began to pinch. They caught the flesh and seemed to tear it;
it was like knives. All his body was on fire. Then the
fingers seemed to be all over his limbs. They crept down to
his hip, his thigh. They bit into his flesh, and then he knew
that Morelli was pressing some nerve in his hip and pushing
it from the socket. At that moment he himself became aware,
for the first time, of Morelli’s body. He pressed against his
chest and his fingers had torn the man’s clothes away.
Morelli’s chest was hairy like an animal’s and cold as marble.
He was sweating in every pore, but Morelli was icy cold.
He dug his nails into the flesh, but they seemed to slip away.
His arm was right round Morelli’s body; the cold flesh slipped
and shrunk beneath his touch. His mouth was against
Morelli’s neck. He had a sudden wild impulse to bite. He
was becoming a wild beast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Morelli seemed to encircle the whole of him. Every
part of his body was touched by those horrible fingers—his
arms, his neck; it was as though he were being bitten to
death. Then he felt in his neck teeth; something was biting
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He screamed again and again, but only a hoarse murmur
seemed to come from his lips. He was still struggling, but
he was going; the room seemed full of animals. They were
biting him, tearing him; and then again he could feel the
soft fingers stealing about his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious feeling of sleepiness stole over him. The pain
in his shoulder and his arm was so terrible that he wanted to
die; his body twitched with a fresh spasm of pain. Things—he
did not know what they were—were creeping up his
legs; soon they would be at his chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that they were both naked to the waist. He could
feel the blood trickling down his face and his arms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was in the room! Yes, Tony. How was he there?
Never mind! He would help him! “Tony! Tony!
They’re doing for me!” Tony was all over the room. He
pulled himself together, and suddenly fell against the knob of
the door. They fell against it together. He hit at the other’s
naked body, hit at it again and again. Strength seemed to
pour back into his body in a flood. He had been nearly on
his knees, but now he was pressing up again. He snatched
at the hand about his neck and tore it away. Again they
were surging about the room. His hand was upon the door.
Morelli’s hands were about his and tried to drag it away, but
he clung. For an age they seemed to hang there, panting,
heaving, clutching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he had turned it. The door flew open and his foot
lunged out behind him. He kicked with all his force, but
he touched nothing. There was nothing there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked back. The door was open. There was a grey
light over the room. Something was muttering, making a
noise like a dog over a bone. He could hear the ticking of
the clock through the open door; it struck nine. There was
perfect stillness; no one was near him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then silently, trembling in every limb, he crept down the
stairs. In a moment he was in the street.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>NIGHT OF THE TWENTY-SEVENTH—MARADICK AND</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>MRS. LESTER</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the gods had not yet done with his night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the sharp night air met him he realised that his
clothes were torn apart and that his chest was bare. He
pulled his shirt about him again, stupidly made movements
with his hand as though he would brush back the hair from
his eyes, and then found that it was blood that was trickling
from a wound in his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed to touch something in him, so that he suddenly
leaned against the wall and, with his head in his arm,
began to cry. There was no reason really why he should
cry; in fact, he didn’t want to cry—it was like a woman to
cry. He repeated it stupidly to himself, “like a woman,
like a woman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he began slowly to fling himself together, as it were;
to pick up the bits and to feel that he, Maradick, still existed
as a personal identity. He pulled his clothes about him and
looked at the dark house. It was absolutely silent; there
were no lights anywhere. What had happened? Was
Morelli looking at him now from some dark corner, watching
him from behind some black window?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, as his head grew cooler under the influence of
the night air, another thought came to him. What was the
little parlour-maid doing? What would happen to her, shut
up all night in that house alone with that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? Ought he
to go back? He could see her cowering, down in the basement
somewhere, having heard probably the noise of the
crashing lamp, terrified, waiting for Morelli to find her.
Yes, he ought to go back. Then he knew that nothing, nothing
in the world—no duty and no claim, no person, no power—could
drive him back into that house again. He looked
back on it afterwards as one of the most shameful things in
his life, that he had not gone back to see what had happened
to the girl; but he could not go, nothing would make him.
It was not anything physical that he might have to face. If
it had been ordinary normal odds—a “scrap,” as he would
call it—then he would have faced it without hesitation.
But there was something about that struggle upstairs that
made him sick; it was something unreal, unclean, indecent.
It had been abnormal, and all that there had been in it had not
been the actual struggle, the blows and wounds, but something
about it that must be undefined, unnamed: the “air,”
the “atmosphere” of the thing, the sudden throwing down
of the decent curtain that veils this world from others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he couldn’t analyse it like that now. He only felt
horribly sick at the thought of it, and his one urgent idea
was to get away, far, far away, from the house and all that
it contained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was very dark; no one would see him. He
must get back to the hotel and slip up to his room and try
and make himself decent. He turned slowly up the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as his thoughts became clearer, he was conscious of
a kind of exultation at its being over. So much more than
the actual struggle seemed to be over; it swept away all the
hazy moral fog that he had been in during the last weeks.
In casting off Morelli, in flinging him from him physically as
well as morally, he seemed to have flung away all that belonged
to him—the wildness, the hot blood, the unrest that
had come to him! He wondered whether after all Morelli
had not had a great deal to do with it. There were more
things in it all than he could ever hope to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, on top of it all, came an overwhelming sensation
of weariness. He went tottering up the hill with his
eyes almost closed. Tired! He had never felt so tired in
his life before. He was already indifferent to everything
that had happened. If only he might just lie down for a
minute and close his eyes; if only he hadn’t got this horrible
hill to climb! It would be easier to lie down there in the
hedge somewhere and go to sleep. He considered the advisability
of doing so. He really did not care what happened to
him. And then the thought came to him that Morelli was
coming up the hill after him; Morelli was waiting probably
until he <span class='it'>did</span> fall asleep, and then he would be upon him.
Those fingers would steal about his body again, there would
be that biting pain. He struggled along. No, he must not
stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he was in the hotel garden. He could hear voices
and laughter from behind closed doors, but there seemed to
be no one in the hall. He stumbled up the stairs to his room
and met no one on the way. His bath seemed to him the
most wonderful thing that he had ever had. It was steaming
hot, and he lay absolutely motionless with his eyes closed
letting his brain very slowly settle itself. It was like a
coloured puzzle that had been shaken to pieces and scattered;
now, of their own initiative, all the little squares and corners
seemed to come together again. He was able to think sanely
and soberly once more, and, above all, that terrible sensation
of having about him something unreal was leaving him. He
began to smile now at the things that he had imagined about
Morelli. The man had been angry at his helping Janet to
run away—that was natural enough; he was, of course, hot-tempered—that
was the foreign blood in him. Thank God,
the world wasn’t an odd place really. One fancied things, of
course, when one was run down or excited, but those silly
ideas didn’t last long if a man was sensible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found that the damage wasn’t very serious. There
were bruises, of course, and nasty scratches, but it didn’t
amount to very much. As he climbed out of the bath, and
stretched his limbs and felt the muscles of his arms, he was
conscious of an enormous relief. It was all over; he was
right again once more. And then suddenly in a flash he remembered
Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, that was over, of course. But to-night was Thursday.
He had promised to see her. He must have one last
talk, just to tell her that there must be nothing more of the
kind. As he slowly dressed, delighting in the cool of clean
linen, he tried to imagine what he would say; but he was
tired, so dreadfully tired! He couldn’t think; he really
couldn’t see her to-night. Besides, it was most absolutely
over, all of it. He had gone through it all in the church
that afternoon. He belonged to his wife now, altogether;
he was going to show her what he could be now that he understood
everything so much better; and she was going to
try too, she had promised him in that funny way the other
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was so tired; he couldn’t think connectedly. They
all got mixed up, Morelli and Mrs. Lester, Tony and his
wife. He stood, trying with trembling fingers to fasten his
collar. The damned stud! how it twisted about! When he
had got its silly head one way and was slipping the collar
over it, then suddenly it slipped round the other way and
left his fingers aching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! he supposed he must see her. After all, it was better
to have it out now and settle it, settle it once and for ever.
These women—beastly nuisance. Damn the stud!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had considered the question of telling the family and
had decided to leave it until the morning. He was much too
tired to face them all now with their questions and anger and
expostulation. Oh! he’d had enough of that, poor man!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, there wouldn’t be any anxiety until the morning.
Tony was so often late, and although Sir Richard
would probably fume and scold at his cutting dinner again,
still, he’d done it so often. No, Lady Gale was really the
question. If she worried, if she were going to spend an
anxious night thinking about it, then he ought to go and tell
her at once. But she probably had a pretty good idea about
the way things had gone. She would not be any more anxious
now than she had been during all these last weeks, and he
really felt, just now, physically incapable of telling her. No,
he wouldn’t see any of them yet. He would go up to the
room of the minstrels and think what he was to do. He
always seemed to be able to think better up there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Lester! What was he to do about her? He
felt now simply antagonism. He hated her, the very thought
of her! What was he doing with that kind of thing? Why
couldn’t he have left her alone?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A kind of fury seized him at the thought of her! He
shook his fist at the ceiling and scowled at the looking-glass;
then he went wearily to the room. But it was dark, and he
was frightened now by the dark. He stood on the threshold
scarcely daring to enter. Then with trembling fingers he
felt for the matches and lit the two candles. But even then
the light that they cast was so uncertain, they left so many
corners dark, and then there were such strange grey lights
under the gallery that he wasn’t at all happy. Lord! what a
state his nerves were in!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was afraid lest he should go to sleep, and then anything
might happen. He faced the grey square of the window
with shrinking eyes; it was through there that the green
lizards .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have liked to have crossed the room to prevent
the window from rattling if he’d had the courage, but the
sound of his steps on the floor frightened him. He remembered
his early enthusiasm about the room. Well, that was
a long, long time ago. Not long in hours, he knew, but
in experience! It was another lifetime!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the tower that he wanted. He could see it now,
in the market-place, so strong and quiet and grey! That
was the kind of thing for him to have in his mind: rest and
strength. Drowsing away in his chair—the candles flinging
lions and tigers on the wall, the old brown of the gallery
sparkling and shining under the uneven light—the tower
seemed to come to him through all the black intervening space
of night. It grew and grew, until it stood beyond the window,
great grey and white stone, towering to the sky, filling
the world; that and the sea alone in all creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was nearly asleep, his head forward on his chest, his
arms hanging loosely over the sides of the chair, when he
heard the door creak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started up in sudden alarm. The candles did not fling
their circle of light as far as the door—<span class='it'>that</span> was in darkness,
a black square darker than the rest of the world; and then
as his eyes stared at it he saw that there was a figure outlined
against it, a grey, shadowy figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a whisper he stammered, “Who is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she came forward into the circle of the candles—Mrs.
Lester! Mrs. Lester in her blue silk dress cut very low,
Mrs. Lester with diamonds in her hair and a very bright red
in her cheeks, Mrs. Lester looking at him timidly, almost
terrified, bending a little forward to stare at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! it’s you!” He could hear her breath of relief. “I
didn’t know, I thought it might be!” She stood staring at
him, a little smile hovering on her lips, uncertainly, as though
it were not sure whether it ought to be there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! it’s you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up and faced her, leaning heavily with one hand
on the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted to tell her to go away; that he was tired and
wasn’t really up to talking—the morning would be better.
But he couldn’t speak. He could do nothing but stand there
and stare at her stupidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at last, in a voice that did not seem his own at all,
he said, “Won’t you sit down?” She laughed, leaning forward
a little with both hands on the green baize table, looking
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mind, do you? If you do, I’ll go at once.
But it’s our last evening. We may not see much of each other
again, and I’d like you to understand me.” Then she sat
down in a chair by the table, her dress rustling like a sea
about her. The candle light fell on it and her, and behind
her the room was dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maradick sat with his head hidden by his hand. He
did not want to look at her, he did not want to speak to her.
Already the fascination of her presence was beginning to steal
over him again. It had been easy enough whilst she had been
away to say that he did not care. But now the scent, violets,
that she used came very delicately across the floor to him.
He seemed to catch the blue of her dress with the corner of
his eye even though he was not looking at her. She filled the
room; the vision that he had had of the tower slipped back
into the night, giving place to the new one. He tapped his
foot impatiently on the floor. Why could she not have left
him alone? He didn’t want any more struggles. He simply
wasn’t up to it, he was so horribly tired. Anything was
better than a struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in a low voice without raising his eyes. “Wasn’t
it—isn’t it—rather risky to come here—like this, now?”
After all, how absurd it was! What heaps of plays he had
seen with their third act just like this. It was all shadowy,
fantastic—the woman, the place. He wanted to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “Risky? Why, no. Fred’s in London.
Nobody else is likely to bother. But Jim, what’s the matter?
What’s happened? Why are you suddenly like this? Don’t
you think it’s a little unkind on our last evening, the last
chance that we shall get of talking? I don’t want to be a
nuisance or a worry——” She paused with a pathetic little
catch in her voice, and she let her hand fall sharply on to the
silk of her dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to pull himself together, to realise the place and
the woman and the whole situation. After all, it was his
fault that she was there, and he couldn’t behave like a cad
after arranging to meet her; and she had been awfully nice
during these weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please.” He raised his eyes at last and looked at
her. “I’m tired, beastly tired; or I was until you came.
Don’t think me rude, but I’ve had an awfully exhausting day,
really awfully exhausting. But of course I want to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was looking so charmingly pretty. Her colour, her
beautiful shoulders, the way that her dress rose and fell with
her breathing—a little hurriedly, but so evenly, like the rise
and fall of some very gentle music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at her and she smiled back. “There, I knew
that you wouldn’t be cross, really; and it is our last time,
isn’t it? And I have got a whole lot of things that I want to
say to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, and he leaned back in his chair again, but
he did not take his eyes off her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know, for a long time I wondered whether I
would come or not; I couldn’t make up my mind. You see,
I’d seen nothing of you at all during these last days, nothing
at all. Perhaps it was just as well. Anyhow, you had other
things to do; and that is, I suppose, the difference between us.
With women, sentiment, romance, call it what you like, is
everything. It is life; but with you men it is only a little
bit, one amongst a lot of other things. Oh! I know. I found
that out long ago without waiting for anyone to tell me. But
now, perhaps, you’ve brought it home to me in a way that I
hadn’t realised before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was going to interrupt her, but she stopped him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t think that I’m complaining about it. It’s
perfectly natural. I know—other men are like that. It’s
only that I had thought that you were a little different, not
quite like the rest; that you had seen it as something precious,
valuable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he had, of course he had. Why, it had made all
the difference in his life. It was all very well his thinking,
as he had that afternoon, that it was Tony or the place or
Punch, one odd thing or another that had made him think
like that, but, as a matter of fact, it was Mrs. Lester, and
no one else. She had shown him all of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you mustn’t think that of me,” he said; “I have
taken it very seriously indeed.” He wanted to say more,
but his head was so heavy that he couldn’t think, and he
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile she was wondering at her own position. She
had come to him that evening in a state of pique. All day she
had determined that she would not go. That was to be the
end of an amusing little episode. And after all, he was only
a great stupid hulk of a thing. He could crush her in his
arms, but then so could any coalheaver. And she had got
such a nice letter from Fred, the dear, that morning. He
had missed her even during the day that he had been away.
Oh yes! she wouldn’t see any more of Mr. Maradick!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she would like to have just a word alone with him.
She expected to see him at teatime. But no; Sir Richard and
Rupert had seen him at the station and he had said that he
was following them back. But no; well, then, at dinner.
Neither Tony nor he were at dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh well! he couldn’t care very much about her if he could
stay away during the whole of their last day together! She
was well out of it all. She read Fred’s letter a great many
times and kissed it. Then directly after dinner—they were
<span class='it'>so</span> dull downstairs, everyone seemed to have the acutest depression
and kept on wondering where Tony was—she went
to her room and started writing a long, long letter to her
“little pet of a Fredikins”; at least it was going to be a long,
long letter, and then somehow it would not go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Maradick was a beast. If he thought that he could
just play fast and loose with women like that, do just what
he liked with them, he was mightily mistaken. She flung
down her pen. The room was stifling! She went to her
window and opened it; she leaned out. Ah! how cool and
refreshing the night air was. There was somebody in the distance
playing something. It sounded like a flute or a pipe.
How nice and romantic! She closed the window. After all,
where was he? He must be somewhere all this time. She
must speak to him just once before she went away. She
must, even though it were only to tell him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then she
remembered that dusty, empty room upstairs. He had told
her that he often went up there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she came. That was the whole history of it. She
hadn’t, when she came into the room, the very least idea
of anything that she was going to do or say. Only that
it was romantic, and that she had an extraordinarily urgent
desire to be crushed once more in those very strong
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have taken it very seriously indeed.” He wondered,
as he said it to her, what it was, exactly, that he had taken
seriously. The “it” was very much more than simply Mrs.
Lester; he saw that very clearly. She was only the expression
of a kind of mood that he had been in during these last
weeks, a kind of genuine atmosphere that she stood for, just
as some quite simple and commonplace thing—a chair, a picture,
a vase of flowers—sometimes stands for a great experience
or emotion. And then—his head was clearer now; that
led him to see further still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly grasped that she wasn’t really for him a
woman at all, that, indeed, she never had been. He hadn’t
thought of her as the woman, the personal character and
identity that he wanted, but simply as a sort of emotional
climax to the experiences that he had been having; any
other woman, he now suddenly saw, would have done just as
well. And then, the crisis being over, the emotional situation
being changed, the woman would remain; that would be
the hell of it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that led him—all this in the swift interval before she
answered him—to wonder whether she, too, had been wanting
him also, not as a man, not as James Maradick, but simply
as a cap to fit the mood that she was in: any man would fit
as well. If that were the case with her as well as with him
what a future they were spared by his suddenly seeing as
clearly as he did. If that were not so, then the whole thing
bristled with difficulties; but that was what he must set
himself to find out, now, at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in her next speech, he saw two things quite clearly—that
she was determined, come what might, to have her
way about to-night at any rate, and to go to any lengths
to obtain it. She might not have been determined when she
came into the room, but she was determined now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant forward in her chair towards him, her cheeks
were a little redder, her breath was coming a little faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, I know you meant it seriously. I know you mean
it seriously now. But there isn’t much time; and after all,
there isn’t much to say. We’ve arranged it all before. We
were to have this night, weren’t we, and then, afterwards,
we’d arrange to go abroad or something. Here we are, two
modern people, you and I, looking at the thing squarely. All
our lives we’ve lived stupidly, dully, comfortably. There’s
never been anything in the very least to disturb us. And
now suddenly this romance has come. Are we, just because
of stupid laws that stupid people made hundreds of years ago,
to miss the chance of our lives? Jim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put one hand across towards him and touched his knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he, looking her steadily in the face, spoke without moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” he said. “Stop. I want to ask you a question.
Do you love me—really, I mean? So that you would go
with me to-morrow to Timbuctoo, anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant she lowered her eyes, then she said vehemently,
eagerly, “Of course, of course I do. You know—Jim,
how can you ask? Haven’t I shown it by coming
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was exactly what she hadn’t done. Her coming
there showed the opposite, if anything; and indeed, at once,
in a way that she had answered him, he had seen the truth.
She might think, at that moment, quite honestly that she loved
him, but really what she wanted was not the man at all, but
the expression, the emotion, call it what you will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he saw, too, exactly what the after-results would be.
They would both of them in the morning postpone immediate
action. They would wait a few weeks. She would return to
her husband; for a little, perhaps, they would write. And
then gradually they would forget. She would begin to look
on it as an incident, a “romantic hour”; she would probably
sigh with relief at the thought of all the ennui and
boredom that she had avoided by not running away with him.
He, too, would begin to regard it lightly, would put it down
to that queer place, to anything and everything, even perhaps
to Morelli; and then—well, it’s no use in crying over spilt
milk, and there’s no harm done after all—and so on, until at
last it would be forgotten altogether. And so “the unforgiveable
sin” would have been committed, “the unforgiveable
sin,” not because they had broken social laws and conventions,
but because they had acted without love—the unforgiveable
sin of lust of the flesh for the sake of the flesh
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her answer to his question she paused for a moment,
and he said nothing; then she went on again: “Of course,
you know I care, with all my heart and soul.” She said the
last three words with a little gasp, and both her hands pressed
tightly together. She had moved her chair closer to his, and
now both her hands were on his knee and her face was raised
to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you would go away with me to-morrow anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course,” she answered, now without any hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that you would lose your good name, your life
at home, your friends, most of them? Everything that has
made life worth living to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then there is your husband. He has been very good
to you. He has never given you the least cause of complaint.
He’s been awfully decent to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! he doesn’t care. It’s you, Jim; I love you heart and
soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he knew through it all that she didn’t: the very
repetition of the phrase showed that. She was trying, he
knew, to persuade herself that she did because of the immediate
pleasure that it would bring her. She wasn’t consciously
insincere, but he shrank back in his chair from her
touch, because he was not sure what he would do if he let her
remain there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put her hands aside firmly. “No, you mustn’t. Look
here, I’ve something to tell you. I know you’ll think me an
awful cad, but I must be straight with you. I’ve found out
something. I’ve been thinking all these days, and, you know,
I don’t love you as I thought I did. Not in the fine way
that I imagined; I don’t even love you as I love my wife. It
is only sensual, all of it. It’s your body that I want, not
you. That sounds horrible, doesn’t it? I know, I’m
ashamed, but it’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice sank into a whisper. He expected her to turn on
him with scorn, loathing, hatred. Perhaps she would even
make a scene. Well, that was better, at any rate, than going
on with it. He might just save his soul and hers in time.
But he did not dare to look at her. He was ashamed to raise
his eyes. And then, to his amazement, he felt her hand on
his knee again. Her face was very close to his and she was
speaking very softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—perhaps—dear, that other kind of love will come.
That’s really only one part of it. That other love cannot
come at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his eyes to her. She was looking at him, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t understand, you can’t?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then something savage in him began to stir. He caught
her hands in his fiercely, roughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you can’t. I tell you I don’t love you at all. Not
as a decent man loves a decent woman. A few weeks ago I
thought that I had found my soul. I saw things differently;
it was a new world, and I thought that you had shown it me.
But it was not really you at all. It isn’t I that you care for,
it’s your husband, and we are both being led by the devil—here—now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” she said, drawing back a little. “I thought you
were braver than that. You do care for all the old conventional
things after all, ‘the sanctity of the marriage tie,’ and
all the rest of it. I thought that we had settled all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered her. “It isn’t the conventions that I
care for, but it’s our souls, yours and mine. If we loved
each other it would be a different thing; but I’ve found out
there’s something more than thrilling at another person’s
touch—that isn’t enough. I don’t love you; we must end it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” She had knelt down by his chair and had suddenly
taken both his hands in hers, and was kissing them
again and again. “No, Jim, we must have to-night. Never
mind about the rest. I want you—now. Take me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her arms were about him. Her head was on his chest.
Her fascination began to steal about him again. His blood
began to riot. After all, what were all these casuistries, this
talk about the soul? Anyone could talk, it was living that
mattered. He began to press her hands; his head was swimming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly a curious thing happened. The room
seemed to disappear. Mrs. Maradick was sitting on the edge
of her bed looking at him. He could see the pathetic bend of
her head as she looked at him. He felt once again, as he had
felt in Morelli’s room, as though there were devils about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was tired again, dog-tired; in a moment he was going
to yield. Both women were with him again. Beyond the
window was the night, the dark hedges, the white road, the
tower, grey and cold with the shadow lying at its feet and
moving with the moon as the waves move on the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the fire seized him. He felt nothing but
her body—the pressure, the warmth of it. His fingers grated
a little on the silk of her dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was perfect silence, and he thought that he could
hear, beyond the beating of their hearts, the sounds of the
night—the rustle of the trees, the monotonous drip of water,
the mysterious distant playing of the flute that he had heard
before. His hands were crushing her. In another moment
he would have bent and covered her face, her body, with
kisses; then, like the coming of a breeze after a parching
stillness, the time was past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and gently put her hands away. He walked
across the room and looked out at the stars, the moon, the light
on the misty trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had won his victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was quite quiet when he spoke to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better, we had both better go to bed. It must
never happen, to either of us, because it isn’t good enough.
I’m not the sort of man, you’re not the sort of woman, that
that does for; you know that you don’t really love me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had risen too, and now stood by the door, her head
hanging a little, her hands limply by her side. Then she
gave a hard little laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve rather given myself away,” she said harshly.
“Only, don’t you think it would have been kinder, honester,
to have said this a week ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t try to excuse myself,” he said quietly. “I’ve
been pretty rotten, but that’s no reason——” He stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clenched her hands, and then suddenly flung up her
head and looked at him across the room furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Mr. Maradick,” she said, and was gone.</p>

<h1 id='ch20'>CHAPTER XX</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>MARADICK TELLS THE FAMILY, HAS BREAKFAST WITH HIS</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>WIFE, AND SAYS GOOD-BYE TO SOME FRIENDS</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was because his fatigue lay upon him like
a heavy burden, so that to close his eyes was as though he
allowed a great weight to fall upon him and crush him. His
fatigue hung above him like a dark ominous cloud; it seemed
indeed so ominous that he was afraid of it. At the moment
when sleep seemed to come to him he would pull himself
back with a jerk, he was afraid of his dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards about four o’clock in the morning he fell into
confused slumber. Shapes, people—Tony, Morelli, Mrs.
Lester, his wife, Epsom, London—it was all vague, misty,
and, in some incoherent way, terrifying. He wanted to
wake, he tried to force himself to wake, but his eyes refused
to open, they seemed to be glued together. The main impression
that he got was of saying farewell to some one, or rather
to a great many people. It was as though he were going
away to a distant land, somewhere from which he felt that he
would never return. But when he approached these figures
to say good-bye they would disappear or melt into some one
else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half-past six he awoke and lay tranquilly watching
the light fill the windows and creep slowly, mysteriously,
across the floor. His dreams had left him, but in spite of
his weariness when he had gone to bed and the poor sleep
that he had had he was not tired. He had a sensation of
relief, of having completed something and, which was of
more importance, of having got rid of it. A definite period
in his life seemed to be ended, marked off. He had something
of the feeling that Christian had when his pack left
him. All the emotions, the struggles, the confusions of the
last weeks were over, finished. He didn’t regret them; he
welcomed them because of the things that they had taught
him, but he did not want them back again. It was almost
like coming through an illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that it was going to be a difficult day. There
were all sorts of explanations, all kinds of “settling up.”
But he regarded it all very peacefully. It did not really
matter; the questions had all been answered, the difficulties
all resolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At half-past seven he got up quietly, had his bath and
dressed. When he came back into the bedroom he found
that his wife was still asleep. He watched her, with her
head resting on her hand and her hair lying in a dark cloud
on the pillow. As he stood above her a great feeling of
tenderness swept over him. That was quite new; he had
never thought of her tenderly before. Emmy Maradick
wasn’t the sort of person that you did think of tenderly.
Probably no one had ever thought of her in that way before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now—things had all changed so in these last weeks.
There were two Emmy Maradicks. That was his great discovery,
just of course as there were two James Maradicks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hadn’t any illusion about it. He didn’t in the least
expect that the old Emmy Maradick would suddenly disappear
and never come out again. That, of course, was absurd,
things didn’t happen so quickly. But now that he knew
that the other one, the recent mysterious one that he had seen
the shadow of ever so faintly, was there, everything would be
different. And it would grow, it would grow, just as this
new soul of his own was going to grow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst he looked at her she awoke, looked at him for a
moment without realisation, and then gave a little cry:
“Oh! Is it late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, just eight. I’ll be back for breakfast at quarter
to nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her eyes was again that wondering pathetic little question.
As an answer he bent down and kissed her tenderly.
He had not kissed her like that for hundreds of years. As
he bent down to her her hands suddenly closed furiously about
him. For a moment she held him, then she let him go. As
he left the room his heart was beating tumultuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he went downstairs to face the music, as he told
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked on the Gales’ sitting-room door and some one
said “Come in.” He drew a deep breath of relief when he
saw that Lady Gale was in there alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that’s good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting by the window with her head towards
him. She seemed to him—it was partly the grey silk dress
that she wore and partly her wonderful crown of white hair—unsubstantial,
as though she might fade away out of the
window at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had even a feeling that he ought to clutch at her,
hold her, to prevent her from disappearing. Then he saw
the dark lines under her eyes and her lack of colour; she
was looking terribly tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I am ashamed; I ought to have told you last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him her hand and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s all right; it’s probably better as it is. I won’t
deny that I was anxious, of course, that was natural. But
I was hoping that you would come in now, before my husband
comes in. I nearly sent a note up to you to ask you to
come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her charming kindness to him moved him strangely. Oh!
she was a wonderful person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Lady,” he said, “that’s like you. Not to be furious
with me, I mean. But of course that’s what I’m here
for now, to face things. I expect it and I deserve it; I was
left for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Left?” she said, looking at him. He saw that her hand
moved ever so quickly across her lap and then back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Of course Tony’s gone. He was married yesterday
afternoon at two o’clock at the little church out on the
hill. The girl’s name is Janet Morelli. She is nineteen.
They are now in Paris; but he gave me this letter for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed her the letter that Tony had given to him on
the way up to the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not say anything to him, but took the letter quickly
and tore it open. She read it twice and then handed it to
him and waited for him to read it. It ran:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dearest and most wonderful of Mothers</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time that you get this I shall be in Paris and
Janet will be my wife. Janet Morelli is her name, and you
will simply love her when you see her. Do you remember
telling me once that whatever happened I was to marry the
right person? Well, suddenly I saw her one night like
Juliet looking out of a window, and there was never any
question again; isn’t it wonderful? But, of course, you
know if I had told you the governor would have had to
know, and then there would simply have been the dickens
of a rumpus and I’d have got kicked out or something,
and no one would have been a bit the better and it would
have been most awfully difficult for you. And so I kept
it dark and told Maradick to. Of course the governor will
be sick at first, but as you didn’t know anything about it
he can’t say anything to you, and that’s all that matters.
Because, of course, Maradick can look after himself, and
doesn’t, as a matter of fact, ever mind in the least what
anyone says to him. We’ll go to Paris directly afterwards,
and then come back and live in Chelsea, I expect. I’m
going to write like anything; but in any case, you know,
it won’t matter, because I’ve got that four hundred a year
and we can manage easily on that. The governor will soon
get over it, and I know that he’ll simply love Janet really.
Nobody could help it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And oh! mother dear, I’m so happy. I didn’t know one
could be so happy; and that’s what you wanted, didn’t
you? And I love you all the more because of it, you and
Janet. Send me just a line to the Hôtel Lincoln, Rue de
Montagne, Paris, to say that you forgive me. Janet sends
her love. Please send her yours.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Ever your loving son,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Tony</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PS.—Maradick has been simply ripping. He’s the most
splendid man that ever lived. I simply don’t know what
we’d have done without him.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a minute or two. Then she said
softly, “Dear old Tony. Tell me about the girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s splendid. There’s no question at all about her being
the right thing. I’ve seen a lot of her, and there’s really
no question at all. She’s seen nothing of the world and has
lived down here all her life. She’s simply devoted to Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And her people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only her father. He’s a queer man. She’s
well away from him. I don’t think he cares a bit about her,
really. They’re a good old family, I believe. Italians
originally, of course. The father has a good deal of the
foreigner in him, but the girl’s absolutely English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another pause, and then she looked up and
took his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t thank you enough. You’ve done absolutely the
right thing. There was nothing else but to carry it through
with a boy of Tony’s temperament. I’m glad, gladder than
I can tell you. But of course my husband will take it rather
unpleasantly at first. He had ideas about Tony’s marrying,
and he would have done anything he could to have prevented
its happening like this. But now that it has happened, now
that there’s nothing to be done but to accept it, I think it will
soon be all right. But perhaps you had better tell him now
at once, and get it over. He will be here in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant they came in—Sir Richard, Rupert, Alice
Du Cane, and Mrs. Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was obvious at once that Sir Richard was angry.
Rupert was amused and a little bored. Alice was excited,
and Mrs. Lester tired and white under the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this?” said Sir Richard, coming forward.
“They tell me that Tony hasn’t been in all night. That he’s
gone or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he caught sight of Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Maradick—Morning! Do you happen to know
where the boy is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick thought that he could discern through the old
man’s anger a very real anxiety, but it was a difficult moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gale spoke. “Mr. Maradick has just been telling
me——” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps Alice and I——” said Mrs. Lester, and moved
back to the door. Then Maradick took hold of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please don’t go. There’s nothing that anyone
needn’t know, nothing. I have just been telling Lady Gale,
Sir Richard, that your son was married yesterday at two
o’clock at the little church outside the town, to a Miss Janet
Morelli. They are now in Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence. No one spoke or moved. The situation
hung entirely between Sir Richard and Maradick.
Lady Gale’s eyes were all for her husband; the way that he
took it would make a difference to the rest of their married
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard breathed heavily. His face went suddenly
very white. Then in a low voice he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married? Yesterday?” He seemed to be collecting
his thoughts, trying to keep down the ungovernable passion
that in a moment would overwhelm him. For a moment
he swallowed it. Holding himself very straight he looked
Maradick in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why has my dutiful son left the burden of this
message to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I have, from the beginning, been concerned in
the affair. I have known about it from the first. I was
witness of their marriage yesterday, and I saw them off at
the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard began to breathe heavily. The colour came
back in a flood to his cheeks. His eyes were red. He
stepped forward with his fist uplifted, but Rupert put a
hand on his arm and his fist fell to his side. He could not
speak coherently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you—you”; and then “You dared? What the
devil have you to do with my boy? With us? With our
affairs? What the devil is it to do with you? You—you—damn
you, sir—my boy—married to anybody, and because
a——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert again put his hand on his father’s arm and his
words lingered in mid-air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—did you know about this—did you know that
this was going on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Maradick saw how wise she had been in her decision
to keep the whole affair away from her. It was a turning-point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she had been privy to it, Maradick saw, Sir Richard
would never forgive her. It would have remained always as
a hopeless, impassable barrier between them. It would have
hit at the man’s tenderest, softest place, his conceit. He
might forgive her anything but that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was a tremendous clearing of the air when she
raised her eyes to her husband’s and said, without hesitation,
“No, Richard. Of course not. I knew nothing until just
now when Mr. Maradick told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Richard turned back from her to Maradick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so, sir, you see fit, do you, sir, to interfere in matters
in which you have no concern. You come between son and
father, do you? You——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But again he stopped. Maradick said nothing. There
was nothing at all to say. It was obvious that the actual
affair, Tony’s elopement, had not, as yet, penetrated to
Sir Richard’s brain. The only thing that he could grasp
at present was that some one—anyone—had dared to step
in and meddle with the Gales. Some one had had the dastardly
impertinence to think that he was on a level with the
Gales, some one had dared to put his plebeian and rude
fingers into a Gale pie. Such a thing had never happened
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Words couldn’t deal with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked as though in another moment he would have
a fit. He was trembling, quivering in every limb. Then,
in a voice that could scarcely be heard, he said, “My God,
I’ll have the law of you for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned round and, without looking at anyone, left the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert said “My word!” and whistled. No one else
said anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in this interval of silence, Maradick almost, to his
own rather curious surprise, entirely outside the whole affair,
was amused rather than bothered by the way they all took
it, although “they,” as a matter of strict accuracy, almost
immediately resolved itself down to Mrs. Lester. Lady Gale
had shown him, long ago, her point of view; Sir Richard
and Rupert could have only, with their limited conventions,
one possible opinion; Alice Du Cane would probably be
glad for Tony’s sake and so be indirectly grateful; but Mrs.
Lester! why, it would be, he saw in a flash, the most splendid
bolstering up of the way that she was already beginning to
look on last night’s affair. He could see her, in a day or
two, making his interference with the “Gale pie” on all
fours with his own brutal attack on her immaculate virtues.
It would be all of a piece in a short time, with the perverted
imagination that she would set to play on their own “little”
situation. It would be a kind of rose-coloured veil that she
might fling over the whole proceeding. “The man who can
behave in that kind of way to the Gales is just the kind of
man who would, so horribly and brutally, insult a defenceless
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw in her eyes already the beginning of the picture.
In a few days the painting would be complete. But this
was all as a side issue. His business, as far as these people
were concerned, was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without looking at anyone, he too left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been difficult, but after he had had Lady Gale’s
assurance the rest didn’t matter. Of course the old man
was bound to take it like that, but he would probably soon
see it differently. And at any rate, as far as he, Maradick,
was concerned, that—Sir Richard’s attitude to him personally—didn’t
matter in the very least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all that affair seemed, indeed, now of secondary importance.
The first and only vital matter now was his relations
with his wife. Everything must turn to that. Her
clasp of his hand had touched him infinitely, profoundly.
For the first time in their married lives she wanted him.
Sir Richard, Mrs. Lester, even Tony, seemed small, insignificant
in comparison with that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he must tell her everything—he saw that. All about
Mrs. Lester, everything—otherwise they would never start
clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was just finishing her dressing when he came into
her room. She turned quickly from her dressing-table towards
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just ready,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” he answered her. “Before we go in to
the girls there’s something, several things, that I want to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His great clumsy body moved across the floor, and he
sat down hastily in a chair by the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched him anxiously with her sharp little eyes.
“Yes,” she said, “only hurry up. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there are two things really,” he answered slowly.
“Things you’ve got to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She noticed one point, that he didn’t apologise in advance
as he would have done three weeks ago. There were no
apologies now, only a stolid determination to get through
with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, it’s about young Tony Gale. I’ve just been telling
his family. He married a girl yesterday and ran
off to Paris with her. You can bet the family are
pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Maradick was excited. “Not really! Really
eloped? That Gale boy! How splendid! A real elopement!
Of course one could see that something was up.
His being out so much, and so on; I knew. But just fancy!
Really doing it! Won’t old Sir Richard——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were sparkling. The romance of it had obviously
touched her, it was very nearly as though one had eloped
oneself, knowing the boy and everything!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he added, “I had to tell them. You see, I’ve known
about it all the time, been in it, so to speak. Helped them
to arrange it and so on, and Sir Richard had a word or two
to say to me just now about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So <span class='it'>that’s</span> what you’ve been doing all this time. <span class='it'>That’s</span>
your secret!” She was just as pleased as she could be.
“That’s what’s changed you. Of course! One might have
guessed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But behind her excitement and pleasure he detected also,
he thought, a note of disappointment that puzzled him.
What had she thought that he had been doing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just been telling them—the Gales. Sir Richard
was considerably annoyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—hateful old man—of course he’d mind; hurt
his pride.” Mrs. Maradick had clasped her hands round her
knees and was swinging a little foot. “But you stood up
to them. I wish I’d seen you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he hurried on. That was, after all, quite unimportant
compared with the main thing that he had to say to
her. He wondered how she would take it. The new idea
that he had of her, the new way that he saw her, was beginning
to be so precious to him, that he couldn’t bear to
think that he might, after all, suddenly lose it. He could see
her, after his telling her, return to the old, sharp, biting
satire. There would be the old wrangles, the old furious
quarrels; for a moment at the thought of it he hesitated.
Perhaps, after all, it were better not to tell her. The episode
was ended. There would never be a recrudescence of it, and
there was no reason why she should know. But something
hurried him on; he must tell her, it was the decent thing
to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s another thing that I must tell you, that I
ought to tell you. I don’t know even that I’m ashamed
of it. I believe that I would go through it all again if I
could learn as much. But it’s all over, absolutely over.
I’ve fancied for the last fortnight that I was in love with
Mrs. Lester. I’ve kissed her and she’s kissed me. You
needn’t be afraid. That’s all that happened, and I’ll never
kiss her again. But there it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung it at her for her to take it or leave it. He hadn’t
the remotest idea what she would say or do. Judging by
his past knowledge of her, he expected her to storm. But
it was a test of the new Mrs. Maradick as to whether, indeed,
it had been all his imagination about there being any
new Mrs. Maradick at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence. He didn’t look at her; and then,
suddenly, to his utter amazement she broke into peals of
laughter. He couldn’t believe his ears. Laughing! Well,
women were simply incomprehensible! He stared at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear!” she said at last, “of course I’ve seen
it all the time. Of course I have, or nearly all the time.
You don’t suppose that I go about with my eyes shut, do
you? Because I don’t, I can tell you. Of course I hated
it at the time. I was jealous, jealous as anything. First
time I’ve been jealous of you since we were married; I hated
that Mrs. Lester anyhow. Cat! But it was an eye-opener,
I can tell you. But there’ve been lots of things happening
since we’ve been here, and that’s only one of them. And
I’m jolly glad. I like women to like you. I’ve liked the
people down here making up to you, and then you’ve been
different too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she crossed over to his chair and suddenly put her
arm around his neck. Her voice lowered. “I’ve fallen in
love with you while we’ve been down here, for the first time
since we’ve been married. I don’t know why, quite. It
started with your being so beastly and keeping it up. You
always used to give way before whenever I said anything
to you, but you’ve kept your end up like anything since
you’ve been here. And then it was the people liking you
better than they liked me. And then it was Mrs. Lester,
my being jealous of her. And it was even more than those
things—something in the air. I don’t know, but I’m seeing
things differently. I’ve been a poor sort of wife most of
the time, I expect; I didn’t see it before, but I’m going to
be different. I could kiss your Mrs. Lester, although I do
hate her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then when he kissed her she thought how big he was.
She hadn’t sat with her arms round him and his great muscles
round her since the honeymoon, and even then she had been
thinking about her trousseau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And breakfast was quite an extraordinary meal. The
girls were amazed. They had never seen their father in
this kind of mood before. They had always rather cautiously
disliked him, as far as they’d had any feeling for him at
all, but their attitude had in the main been negative. But
now, here he was joking, telling funny stories, and mother
laughing. Cutting the tops off their eggs too, and paying
them quite a lot of attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found the meal delightful, too, although he realised
that there was still a good deal of the old Mrs. Maradick left.
Her voice was as shrill as ever; she was just as cross with
Annie for spreading her butter with an eye to self-indulgence
rather than economy. She was still as crude and vulgar
in her opinion of things and people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he didn’t see it any longer in the same way. The
knowledge that there was really the other Mrs. Maradick
there all the time waiting for him to develop, encourage her,
made the things that had grated on him at one time so
harshly now a matter of very small moment. He was even
tender about them. It was a good thing that they’d both
got their faults, a very fortunate thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Annie, there you go, slopping your tea into your
saucer like that, and now it’ll drop all over your dress.
Why <span class='it'>can’t</span> you be more careful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but mother, it was so full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” this from Maradick, “what do you think of our
all having this afternoon down on the beach or somewhere?
Tea and things; just ourselves. After all, it’s our last day,
and it’s quite fine and warm. No more rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone thought it splendid. Annie, under this glorious
new state of things, even found time and courage to
show her father her last French exercise with only three
mistakes. The scene was domestic for the next half-hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he left them. He wanted to go and make his farewell
to the place; this would be the last opportunity that
he would have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t expect to see the Gales again. After all, there
was nothing more for him to say. They had Tony’s address.
It only remained for Sir Richard to get over it as quickly
as he could. Lady Gale would probably manage that. He
would like to have spoken to her once more, but really it
was as well that he shouldn’t. He would write to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He discovered before he left the house that another part
of the affair was over altogether. As he reached the bottom
of the stairs Mrs. Lester crossed the hall, and, for a
moment, they faced each other. She looked through him,
past him, as though she had never seen him before. Her
eyes were hard as steel and as cold. They passed each
other silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not surprised; he had thought that that was the
way that she would probably take it. Probably with the
morning had come fierce resentment at his attitude and fiery
shame at her own. How she could! That would be her
immediate thought, and then, very soon after that, it would
be that she hadn’t at all. He had led her on. And then in
a week’s time it would probably be virtuous resistance against
the persuasions of an odious sensualist. Of course she would
never forgive him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed out into the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went down the hill to the town it struck him that the
strange emotional atmosphere that had been about them during
these weeks seemed to have gone with the going of Tony.
It might be only coincidence, of course, but undoubtedly the
boy’s presence had had something to do with it all. And
then his imagination carried him still further. It was fantastic,
of course, but his struggle with Morelli seemed to have
put an end to the sort of influence that the man had been
having. Because he had had an influence undoubtedly.
And now to-day Morelli didn’t seem to go for anything at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then it might be, too, that they had all at last got
used to the place; it was no longer a fresh thing, but something
that they had taken into their brains, their blood.
Anyhow, that theory of Lester’s about places and people in
conjunction having such influence, such power, was interesting.
But, evolve what theories he might, of one thing he
was certain. There had been a struggle, a tremendous
straggle. They had all been concerned in it a little, but it
had been his immediate affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned down the high road towards the town. The day
was a “china” day; everything was of the faintest, palest
colours, delicate with the delicacy of thin silk, of gossamer
lace washed by the rain, as it were, until it was all a symphony
of grey and white and a very tender blue. It was a
day of hard outlines. The white bulging clouds that lay
against the sky were clouds of porcelain; the dark black row
of trees that bordered the road stood out from the background
as though they had been carved in iron; the ridge of back-lying
hills ran like the edge of a sheet of grey paper against
the blue; the sea itself seemed to fling marble waves upon a
marble shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought, as he paused before he passed into the town,
that he had never seen the sea as it was to-day. Although
it was so still and seemed to make no sound at all, every kind
of light, like colours caught struggling in a net, seemed to be
in it. Mother of pearl was the nearest approach to the
beauty of it, but that was very far away. There was gold
and pink and grey, and the faintest creamy yellow, and the
most delicate greens, and sometimes even a dark edge of
black; but it never could be said that this or that colour
were there, because it changed as soon as one looked at it and
melted into something else; and far away beyond the curving
beach the black rocks plunged into the blue, and seemed to
plant their feet there and then to raise them a little as the
sea retreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed through the market-place and saluted the tower
for the last time. There were very few people about and
he could make his adieux in privacy. He would never forget
it, its grey and white stone, its immovable strength and
superiority to all the rest of its surroundings. He fancied
that it smiled farewell to him as he stood there. It seemed
to say: “You can forget me if you like; but don’t forget
what I’ve taught you—that there’s a spirit and a courage and
a meaning in us all if you’ll look for it. Good-bye; try and
be more sensible and see a little farther than most of your
silly fellow-creatures.” Oh yes! there was contempt in it
too, as it stood there with its white shoulders raised so
proudly against the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tenderly passed his hand over some of the rough grey
stones in a lingering farewell. Probably he’d been worth
something to the tower in an obscure sort of way. He believed
enough in its real existence to think it not fantastic
that it should recognise his appreciation of it and be glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His next farewell was to Punch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He climbed the little man’s dark stairs with some misgiving.
He ought to have been in there more just lately,
especially after the poor man losing his dog. He owed a
great deal to Punch; some people might have found his
continual philosophising tiresome, but to Maradick its sincerity
and the very wide and unusual experience behind it
gave the words a value and authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Punch sitting on his bed trying to teach the
new dog some of the things that it had to learn. He jumped
up when he saw Maradick, and his face was all smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’m that glad to see you,” he said, “I’d been
hopin’ you’d come in before you were off altogether. Yes,
this is the new dog. It ain’t much of a beast, only a mongrel,
but I didn’t want too fine a dog after Toby; it looks like comparison,
in a way, and I’m thinkin’ it might ’urt ’im, wherever
’e is, if ’e knew that there was this new one takin’
’is place altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new one certainly wasn’t very much of a beast, but
it seemed to have an enormous affection for its master and a
quite pathetic eagerness to learn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come and sit down, sir. Never mind them shirts,
I’ll chuck ’em on the floor. No, my boy, we’ve had enough
teachin’ for the moment. ’E’s got an astonishin’ appetite
for learnin’, that dog, but only a limited intelligence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick could see that Punch didn’t want to say any
more about Toby, so he asked no questions, but he could see
that he felt the loss terribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Garrick,” he said, “I’ve come to say good-bye.
We all go back to-morrow, and, on the whole, I don’t know
that I’m sorry. Things have happened here a bit too fast
for my liking, and I’m glad to get out of it with my life,
so to speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch, looked at him a moment, and then he said:
“What’s happened about young Gale, sir? There are all
sorts of stories afloat this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick told him everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s all for the best. I’m damned glad of it.
That girl’s well away, and they’ll make the prettiest married
couple for many a mile. They’ll be happy enough. And
now, you see for yourself that I wasn’t so far out about
Morelli after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick thought for a moment and then he said: “But
look here, Garrick, if Morelli’s what you say, if, after all,
there’s something supernatural about him, he must have
known that those two were going to run away; well, if
he knew and minded so much, why didn’t he stop
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not saying that he did know,” said Punch slowly,
“and I’m not saying that he wanted to stop them. Morelli’s
not a man, nor anything real at all. ’E’s just a kind of
vessel through which emotions pass, if you understand me.
The reason, in a way, that ’e expresses Nature is because
nothing stays with him. ’E’s cruel, ’e’s loving, ’e’s sad, ’e’s
happy, just like Nature, because the wind blows, or the rivers
run, or the rains fall. ’E’s got influence over everything
human because ’e isn’t ’uman ’imself. ’E isn’t a person at
all, ’e’s just an influence, a current of atmosphere in a man’s
form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are things, believe me, sir, all about this world
that take shape one day like this and another day like that,
but they have no soul, no personal identity, that is, because
they have no beginning or end, no destiny or conclusion, any
more than the winds or the sea. And you look out for
yourself when that’s near you—it’s mighty dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick said nothing. Punch went on—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t see these things in cities, or in places where
you’re for ever doing things. You’ve got to have your mind
like an empty room and your eyes must be blind and your
ears must be closed, and then, slowly, you’ll begin to hear
and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maradick shook his head. “No, I don’t understand,” he
said. “And when I get back to my regular work again
I shall begin to think it’s all bunkum. But I do know that
I’ve been near something that I’ve never touched before.
There’s something in the place that’s changed us all for a
moment. We’ll all go back and be all the same again; but
things can’t ever be quite the same again for me, thank
God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch knocked out his pipe against the heel of his boot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man,” he said suddenly, “if you’d just come with me
and walk the lanes and the hills I’d show you things. You’d
begin to understand.” He gripped Maradick’s arm. “Come
with me,” he said, “leave all your stupid life; let me show
you the real things. It’s not worth dying with your eyes
shut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment something in Maradick responded. For a
wild instant he thought that he would say yes. Then he
shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, David, my friend,” he answered. “That’s not my
life. There’s my wife, and there are others. That’s my
line. But it will all be different now. I shan’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punch smiled. “Well, perhaps you’re right. You’ve got
your duty. But just remember that it isn’t only children
we men and women are begetting. We’re creating all the
time. Every time that you laugh at a thought, every time
that you’re glad, every time that you’re seeing beauty and
saying so, every time that you think it’s better to be decent
than not, better to be merry than sad, you’re creating.
You’re increasing the happy population of the world.
Young Gale was that, and now you’ve found it too. That’s
religion; it’s obvious enough. Plenty of other folks have
said the same, but precious few have done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as they said good-bye, he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And remember that I’m there if you want me. I’ll
always come. I’m always ready. All winter I’m in London.
You’ll find me in the corner by the National Gallery, almost
opposite the Garrick Theatre, with my show, most nights;
I’m your friend always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Maradick knew as he went down the dark stairs that
that would not be the last that he would see of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He climbed, for the last time, up the hill that ran above
the sea. Its hard white line ran below him to the town, and
above him across the moor through the little green wood that
fringed the hill. For a moment his figure, black and tiny,
was outlined against the sky. There was a wind up here
and it swept around his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far below him the sea lay like a blue stone, hard and
sharply chiselled. Behind him the white road curved like
a ribbon above him, and around him was the delicate bending
hollow of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he stood there, a tiny doll of a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind whistled past him laughing. Three white clouds
sailed majestically above his head. The hard black body of
the wood watched him tolerantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed again down the white road.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>My dearest Louie</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ve been meaning to write all this week, but so many
things have accumulated since we’ve been away that there’s
simply not been a minute to write a decent letter. No,
Treliss wasn’t very nice this time. You know, dear, the
delightful people that were there last year? Well, there
were none of them this year at all except that Mrs. Lawrence,
who really got on my nerves to such an extent!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some people called Gale we saw something
of—Lady and Sir Richard Gale. I must say I thought
them rather bad form, but Jim liked them; and then their
boy eloped with a girl from the town, which made it rather
thrilling, especially as Sir Richard was simply furious with
Jim because he thought that he’d had something to do with
it. And you can’t imagine how improved dear old Jim is
with it all, really quite another man, and so amusing when
he likes; and people quite ran after him there, you wouldn’t
have believed it. There was a horrid woman, a Mrs. Lester,
who would have gone to any lengths, I really believe, only, of
course, Jim wasn’t having any. I always said that he could
be awfully amusing if he liked and really nice, and he’s
been going out quite a lot since we’ve been back and everybody’s
noticed the difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what do you think? We may be leaving Epsom!
I know it’ll be simply hateful leaving you, dear, but it’ll
only be London, you know, and you can come up whenever
you like and stay just as long as you please, and we’ll be
awfully glad. But Epsom is a little slow, and what Jim says
is quite true—why not be either town or country? It’s
what I’ve always said, you know, and perhaps we’ll have a
little cottage somewhere as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the way, dear, as you are in town I wish you’d just
look in at Harrod’s and see about those patterns. Two and
elevenpence is much too much, and if the ones at two and
sixpence aren’t good enough you might ask for another sort!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do come and see us soon. I might come up for a matinée
some day soon. Write and let me know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was very glad to get your letter this morning. You’ve
been amazingly quick about settling in, but then I expect
that Janet’s an excellent manager. I’ll be delighted to
come to dinner next Wednesday night, and shall look forward
enormously to seeing you both and the kind of home
that you have. I can’t tell you what a relief it is to me
to hear that you are both so happy. Of course I knew that
you would be and always, I hope, will be, but the responsibility
on my part was rather great and I wanted to hear
that it was all right. I’m so glad that your mother likes
Janet so much. I knew that they would get on, and I hope
that very soon your father will come as well and make everything
all right in that direction. We’re all quite settled
down here again now; well, not quite. Treliss has left its
mark on both of us, and we’re even thinking—don’t jump
out of your chair with excitement—of coming up to London
to live. A little wider life will suit both of us better now, I
think. Nothing is settled yet, but I’m going to look about
for a house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Treliss did rather a lot for all of us, didn’t it? It all
seems a little incredible, really; but you’ve got Janet to
show you that it’s real enough, and I’ve got, well, quite a
lot of things, so that it can’t have been all a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well until Wednesday. Then I’ll hear all the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurray! I’m so glad that you can come on Wednesday,
but I’m just wild with joy that you are really coming to
live in London. Hurray again! Only you must, you positively
must come to live in Chelsea. It’s the only possible
place. Everybody who is worth knowing lives here, including
a nice intelligent young couple called Anthony and Janet
Gale. The house—our house—is simply ripping. All
white and distempered by your humble servant; and Janet’s
been simply wonderful. There’s nothing she can’t do, and
everybody all over the place loves her. We haven’t had a
word from her father, so I don’t suppose that he’s going to
take any more trouble in that direction, but I heard from
Garrick the other day—you remember Punch—and he says
that he saw him not long ago sitting on the shore and piping
to the waves with a happy smile on his face. Isn’t he rum?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Minns is here and enjoying herself like anything.
She’s bought a new bonnet and looks no end—my eye! And
what do you think? Who should turn up this morning but
the governor! Looking awfully cross at first, but he couldn’t
stand against Janet; and he went away as pleased as anything,
and says we must have a better sideboard in the dining-room,
and he’s going to give us one. Isn’t that ripping?
The writing’s getting on. I met a fellow at tea the other day,
Randall, he’s editor of the <span class='it'>New Monthly</span>; he was a bit slick
up, but quite decent, and now he’s taken one of my things,
and I’ve had quite a lot of reviewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, good-bye, old chap. You know that Janet and I
would rather have you here than anyone else in the world,
except the mater, of course. We owe you everything. Buck
up and come here to live. Love from Janet.</p>

I are going to be up in town for a night next week and should
awfully like to see you if it’s possible. Fred’s dining that
night with some silly old writer, so if I might just come in
and have a crumb with you I’d be awfully glad. Fred
and I have both decided that we didn’t like Treliss a bit
this year and we’re never going there again. If it hadn’t
been for you I simply don’t know what we’d have done.
There’s something about the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fred felt it too, only he thought it was indigestion. And
then the people! I know you rather liked those Maradick
people. But I thought the man perfectly awful. Of course
one had to be polite, but, my dear, I really don’t think he’s
very nice, not quite the sort of man—oh well! you know!
Not that I’d say anything against him for the world, but
there’s really no knowing how far one can go with a man of
that kind. But of course I scarcely saw anything of them.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Maradick</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ve been wanting to write to you for some days, but
so many things crowd about one in London, and even now
I’ve only got a moment. But I thought that you would
like to know that both my husband and myself have been
to see Tony in Chelsea and that we think Janet perfectly
charming. My husband was conquered by her at once;
one simply cannot help loving her. She is no fool either.
She is managing that house splendidly, and has got a good
deal more common-sense than Tony has.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course now you’ll say that we ought to have shown
her to Sir Richard at once if he’s got to like her so much.
But that isn’t so. I’m quite sure that he would never have
allowed the marriage if there’d been a chance of it’s being
prevented. But now he’s making the best of it, and it’s
easy enough when it’s Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think he feels still sore at your having “interfered,” as
he calls it, but that will soon wear off and then you must
come and see us. Alice Du Cane is staying with us. She
has been so much improved lately, much more human; she’s
really a charming girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And meanwhile, how can I thank you enough for all that
you have I done? I feel as though I owed you everything.
It won’t bear talking or writing about, but I am more grateful
than I can ever say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But keep an eye on Tony. He is devoted to you. He is
still very young, and you can do such a lot for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Please remember me to your wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’m sitting under a hedge with this bit of paper on my
knee; dirty you’ll be thinking it, but I find that waiting
for paper means no letter at all, and so it’s got to be written
when the moment’s there. I’m tramping north—amongst
the lakes I’m making for. It’s fine weather and a hard
white road, and the show’s been going strong these last
days. There’s a purple line of hills behind me, and a
sky that’ll take a lot of poet’s talking to glorify it, and a
little pond at the turn of the road that’s bluer than blue-bells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new dog’s none so stupid as I thought him; not
that he’s Toby, but he’s got a sense of humour on him
that’s more than a basketful of intelligence. Last night I
was in a fine inn with a merry company. I wish that you
could have heard the talking, but you’ll have been dining
with your napkin on your knee and a soft carpet at your
feet. There was a fine fellow last night that had seen the
devil last week walking on the high ridge that goes towards
Raddlestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maybe it was Morelli; like enough. He’s often round that
way. I’m thinking of you often, and I’ll be back in London,
November. I’d like to have you out here, with stars instead
of chimney pots and a red light where the sun’s setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ll write again from the North.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
